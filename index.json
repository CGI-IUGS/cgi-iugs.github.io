The Forum aims to briefly look to the past, assess the present and look forward to the future regarding geoscience information standards. With a small group of invited experts, the Forum will follow a flexible and lightly structured agenda with plenty of time for discussion and brain-storming. The Forum aims to conclude with a sense of purpose and direction around further development of geoscience information standards that are needed.\nBackground of Geoscience Information Standards Many of the geoscience information standards we have today had their origins in geological maps, particularly those produced by geological surveys as part of map series. Map series typically require and achieve levels of consistency around, for example, mapping philosophy, scale, stratigraphic and technical terminology, colour and symbology. These elements were expressed in map style guides, procedures and other technical documentation. Consistency of approach benefits not only the map compiler but also the map user who can switch between maps more easily. The advent of digital geological maps, particularly those built with GIS software, facilitated exchange of information through common software formats and contained feature attributes. One of the drivers was wanting to share geoscience information across jurisdictional borders, whether they be state, province or country. Development of the North America Data Model (NADM) through 1996-2006 involved US and Canada and evolved into Geoscience Markup Language (GeoSciML) through greater international participation involving UK, France, Australia and wider through CGI and more recently the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The seminal OneGeology global geological map project, started in 2007 and involving more than 40 countries, provided the quintessential use case for utilizing geoscience information standards and this accelerated their development and implementation. Geoscience information is much wider than that contained in geological maps and the role of standards is fundamentally to convey information in an understandable way.\nPresent Geoscience Information Standards Landscape The present landscape of geological information standards consists of a mature geology data model (GeoSciML), an advanced minerals and mining data model (EarthResourceML) and many of the geoscience vocabularies needed to support them.\nGeoSciML is a model of geological features commonly described and portrayed in geological maps, cross sections, geological reports and databases. It covers the domain of geology (earth materials, geological units and stratigraphy, geological time, geological structures, geomorphology, geochemistry) and sampling features common to the practice of geoscience, such as boreholes and geological specimens. The specification describes a logical model and GML/XML encoding rules for the exchange of geological map data, geological time scales, boreholes, and metadata for laboratory analyses and its primary goal is to enable information systems to interoperate with such data. GeoSciML’s latest iteration (version 4.1) has been released as an OGC standard. GeoSciML development has tailed off, apart from GeoJSON implementation.\nEarthResourceML is a model of economic geology encompassing mineral occurrences, commodity resource, mining activity, mineral processing and mining waste. Its latest published iteration (version 2.0), implemented by many countries, is undergoing a significant overhaul.\nGroundwaterML is a data model for hydrogeology and there are other data models for specialised geoscience domains such as seismology and emerging areas such as geotechnical. Thus, most of the wider geoscience domain is or will be catered for by logical data models.\nThe geoscience logical data models are supported by controlled vocabularies, that is, lists of terms that are describe properties and relationships of objects. Vocabularies supporting the above logical data models are typical hierarchical with parent-child associations, with synonyms and multi-lingual equivalents, include definitions and sources and are made available in machine-readable formats. CGI’s vocabularies currently number 60.\nThe Ongoing Need for Geoscience Information Standards The requirement to share geoscience information is as important as ever, particularly in an era where machine-to-machine sharing is commonplace and artificial intelligence applications grow. Well-organized geoscience data conforming to information standards are always going to reduce ambiguity and uncertainty to enable clearer patterns to emerge and make possible the production of FAIR data by scientists.\nAmong the questions that this Forum is addressing are:\n How fit-for-purpose are existing geoscience information standards? What improvements are needed for existing geoscience information standards? What new geoscience information standards are needed e.g., new data models, ontologies? What is the role of international groups in guiding and governing geoscience information standards? How are geoscience information standards development and maintenance resourced and by whom? What are the emerging projects and technologies that will benefit from geoscience information standards? Who will benefit by using geoscience information standards? Who are the geoscience information standards leaders, compilers and implementers of the future?

The goal of CGI is to foster the interoperability and exchange of geoscience information, through community leadership, collaboration, education, as well as development and promotion of standards and best practices.\nOn 24 February 2022, at 10 AM UTC, CGI and partner agencies hosted a 3-hour online GeoInfo Summit attended by geoscience information leaders from around the world. CGI Chair Harvey Thorleifson stated that geoscience information is of escalating importance to worldwide society, with increasing emphasis on standardized, machine-readable, data-rich knowledge.\nHe noted that respected international geoscience information organizations happily support each other, and we are coordinating our plans, for example as we prepare for upcoming high-level IUGS meetings. He was pleased that there had been unanimous support for this joint, informal meeting, which had not included ambitious pre-meeting effort.\nThere were talks from CGI, CGI Work Groups, CGMW, Codata, DDE, Loop, OGC, OneGeology, and CGI Planning. Speakers had been asked to present an overview of their background, status, and plans, as well as mention of leadership recruitment, government-university-industry coordination, ensuring sustainability, and defining coordinated and achievable goals.\nHarvey expressed appreciation to the speakers whose presentations are summarized here. Subsequently, on May 19th, a GeoInfo Summit discussion session was held.\nCGI – François Robida François, CGI Past Chair, described how CGI, which focuses on geoscience while benefiting from broader Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) arrangements, emanated from a 2003 Edinburgh meeting of geological survey and industry people, when multiple geological data model initiatives in the context of new standards such as GML, WMS, and WFS resulted in a consensus to build a common model that would permit the interoperability that is essential for humans and machines to conduct data-driven science.\nTo overcome the tendency for everyone to reinvent their own standard, he asserted that we must work together on standards that will be built by recognized and respected, broadly knowledgeable scientists, data scientists, and technical experts, and that are needed, endorsed, and used by the community.\nFrançois stressed the need to manage scientists’ tendency to over-specify complexity, to improve or extend existing standards, to reconcile standards in related fields such as multiple borehole standards, to import procedures from related fields such as 3D, to publicize our work broadly, and to validate our work through testbeds and flagships, through an open consensus-building process.\nIn 2022, he sees a need for renewed coordination among geoscience information organizations, in part by clarifying complementary roles, as well as with industry and academia, as we did in 2003, although we now have a new context such as semantic web, linked data, big data, AI, and 3D, and a need for us to coordinate with ocean and atmosphere. In closing, François stated that we can do nothing without standards.\nCGI Work Groups – Harvey Thorleifson To praise superb work by CGI Work Groups and partner groups, Harvey presented a summary of the CGI webinar that had been held in June 2021, that is available on YouTube, and that was summarized in the August 2021 CGI Newsletter. He also mentioned the September 2021 technical seminar on geoscience ontology and knowledge graph that also is available on YouTube. In addition, he described the comprehensive, 15-hour DDE Geoscience Standards Training in October 2021, for which videos are available on the DDE web site.\nHe described how the OGC Geoscience Domain Working Group (DWG) partners with CGI and others to make geoscience information findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Key DWG goals are interoperability, data definitions, formats, and services for publishing, search, and exchange; thematic/semantic coherence with related domains; interfaces with city/infrastructure and risk domains; showing value added by interoperability; best practices; and standards for spatial and temporal features, metadata, and other information.\nIn addition, an OGC Standard Working Group (SWG) manages GeoSciML (Geoscience Markup Language), an XML- and GML-based machine-readable format for geological maps. EarthResourceML (ERML) is a markup language for the delivery of mineral occurrence, deposit, mining, and resource data. Nineteen ERML vocabularies include mine status, commodity, and reserves; data delivery and implementation are well accommodated.\nThe CGI Geoscience Terminology Working Group maintains terms for earth features, properties, quantities, techniques, and processes that are agreed upon and made widely accessible, including to machines. Geoscience ontology research is being conducted in association with Loop. The Deep-time Digital Earth (DDE) Standards Task Group (DDE-STG) is facilitating adoption of CGI standards and terminology by DDE, the first IUGS-recognized big science programme that was launched in 2019.\nCGMW – Manuel Pubellier and Benjamin Sautter Manuel, with Benjamin Sautter, provided an update on the work of the Commission for the Geological Map of the World (CGMW), an international non-profit association governed by French law that is responsible for designing, coordinating, preparing, and publishing small-scale thematic earth science maps of the globe, continents, major regions, and oceans. CGMW was established as an outcome of the International Geological Congress (IGC), first held in 1878. The commission was conceived in 1910 at the 11th IGC in Stockholm, and established in 1913 at the 12th IGC in Toronto.\nCGMW has several thematic sub-commissions, and an important role in preserving the legacy of important paper maps produced over a century and more, while using current technology to produce the geological mapping databases that are needed for our future. The maps need to be freely accessible on an international basis, and at the same time, someone has to pay. CGMW is working, particularly with CGI and OneGeology, to take forward thinking on development of global seamless 3D databases at multiple levels of resolution.\nAn exciting and important current activity is a new 1:5M seamless geological map of the world, being produced in association with DDE, including much reconciliation aided by imagery and elevation databases, and updated bathymetry and seafloor geology, including mid-oceanic ridges, transforms, seafloor age, and hydrothermal vents.\nCodata – Alena Rybkina Alena described the role of Codata, the Committee on Data of the International Science Council, in building a foundation for a world of open data, by promoting open science and FAIR data. CODATA convenes a global expert community and provides a forum for international consensus building and agreements around a range of data science and data policy issues, from the fundamental physical constants to cross-domain data specifications.\nCodata has national committees, scientific union members, institutional members, and partner organizations. Codata advances data policies, data science, data skills, and data documentation. While citing a report on Advancing Science as a Global Public Good, she stated that the major, pressing global scientific and human issues of the 21st century can only be addressed through research that works across disciplines to understand complex systems, and which uses a transdisciplinary approach. She noted that there are major challenges for many scientific domains that require work on data specifications, semantics, infrastructures, and more, as estimates imply 80% of our effort is spent on data wrangling, due to suboptimal data stewardship.\nNevertheless, much cross-domain collaboration is quickening, to address current global grand challenges. Alena then outlined the FAIR guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship, and a document on Turning FAIR into reality. The Codata data documentation initiative is a cross-domain integration collaboration designed to interface with other standards and to help interoperability between different data types, standards, and formats.\nDDE – Junxuan Fan Junxuan Fan described DDE, for which the kick-off meeting was held at Beijing in February 2019, with representatives of 40 geoscience organizations in attendance, and with 12 founding organizations signing the accord to initiate the DDE program. DDE is a big science program dedicated to facilitating innovation in understanding the Earth\u0026rsquo;s evolution and applications as well as the Sustainable Development Goals utilizing Big Data analytics, internet cloud computing, data mining, machine learning, and AI. The principal theme is harmonizing global deep time geoscience data. The governance includes a governing council, executive committee, science council, science communities, working groups, and task groups. The primary goals are to establish an international consortium, linking isolated databases into an open, distributed system, making data FAIR, linking earth spheres, and promoting innovative earth system research, through data-driven knowledge discovery.\nDDE data-driven knowledge discovery is addressing: 1. Integrating a uniform high-resolution earth time system; 2. Origin and evolution of life and biodiversity; 3. How did sedimentary matter evolve and cycle?; 4. Reconstructing earth climate and atmosphere history from big data of multiple geochemical indices; 5. Global sea-level change through deep time; 6. Quantifying plate tectonics and deformation in 4D; 7. 4D architecture and evolution of deep-earth materials and dynamics; 8. Mineral evolution beyond 4D; 9. A globally shared big-data energy resource system for sustainable development; 10. Geophysical fields for prediction of seismic hazard.\nLoop – Laurent Ailleres Laurent described Loop, an integrated and interoperable platform enabling 3D stochastic geological modelling. The focus of Loop is on providing solutions for subsurface resource management, managing geological knowledge, 3D geological and geophysical modelling, as well as uncertainty risk mitigation. Loop knowledge management is using AI for knowledge extraction from literature, maps, and reports using geological ontology, with geological rules being encoded to ensure proper knowledge extraction. Loop is a time-aware geological modelling platform, and the geological event management is capturing topological and time relationships between geological objects and structural events. Loop forward and inverse structural modelling is encoding structural geological rules in a time-aware context to account for folds, faults, shear zones, unconformities and intrusions. The modelling is based on probabilistic modelling and allows for the definition of an objective function for geology and quantification of uncertainty via posterior probabilities.\nA milestone was reached recently with release of the GeoScience Ontology (GSO). In addition, Map2Loop data pre-processing and input now involves automation of data input for Loop modelling methods, geometrical analysis of geological maps, and topological analysis of the map. Secondary geological information automatically derived from maps includes normalized local formation thickness, and apparent fault throw. Loop Resources involves reducing the mining footprint with curvilinear geostatistics using structural frames.\nPlans for the future include Loop Vision, an interoperable, integrative, automated and update-able workflow to model geology based on structural geological rules and geophysics. A platform will integrate geophysical modelling/constraints upstream with structural geological modelling/constraints. Loop provides a means to characterize and mitigate uncertainty that will guide further data acquisition. The framework accommodates lithology, alteration, mineralogy, metallurgy, geotechnical parameters, and grades, allowing a better characterization of mining block and process optimization.\nOGC – Mickaël Beaufils Mickaël provided an overview of OGC and the GeoScience DWG, that partners with CGI and many other organizations in making geospatial information findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). For findability, he cited persistent identifiers (PIDs), rich metadata, indexed data repositories, and PIDs in metadata; for accessibility, he cited standard communication protocols, open and free protocols, authentication where necessary, and metadata always available; for interoperability, he cited vocabularies, FAIR vocabularies, and linked metadata; and for reusability, he cited multiple attribute metadata, usage licenses, provenance, and community standards.\nHe outlined the OGC innovation continuum, in which an innovation cycle links to a standardization cycle. The innovation cycle involves project identification, call for sponsors, creation of a public call, selection of members, an executive project, and generation of results. This links to the standardization cycle, built on domain and standards working groups, involving DWG discussion, SWG formation, standards development, DWG/SWG presentations, formulation of enhancements, and interest gathering, which links back to the innovation cycle.\nKey DWG goals are interoperability, data definitions, formats, and services for publishing, search, and exchange; thematic/semantic coherence with related domains; interfaces with city/infrastructure and risk domains; showing value added by interoperability; best practices; and standards for spatial and temporal features, metadata, and other information. Emphasis has been on the BhML borehole conceptual model, as well as (Geo)JSON(- LD), 3D-4D, BIM, geotechnics, ISO19156 for observations and measurements, OGC SensorThings API, OGC-API features, and SMART Data Loader. Much emphasis is now on geotech interoperability.\nOneGeology – Matt Harrison Matt spoke on OneGeology, which has 189 member organizations, and is dedicated to providing geoscience data globally. OneGeology technical principles are based on interoperability with emphasis on GeoSciML, data on distributed servers sent directly to the web client, participants delivering map data through a standard OGC web service, cookbooks and online help and buddy systems so all nations can serve their data, a central catalog of services, and a portal that can display and aggregate all of the maps.\nAccording to the 2007 Brighton Accord, OneGeology is a geological survey initiative that will make public and internet-accessible the best available digital geological map data, with priority on interoperable, Internet-accessible, scientifically-attributed data and to make progress at levels appropriate to participants\u0026rsquo; capability.\nOneGeology is now migrating its focus to the application, technology and opportunities arising from developing a multiscale suite of digital twin earth system models. These will enable the better prediction and understanding of subsurface processes and their properties, and how these influence the world around us. The existence and use of an earth system digital twin could, for example, allow users to sample a volume of rock and run numerical simulations to understand the impacts of various inputs and changes to that system, such as alternative energy storage technologies.\nThese digital twin models will be an ensemble of 4D geospatial data, models, and visualizations. One of the key elements will be the cyber–physical interaction, whereby sensor perturbation monitored in the real world will ultimately be reflected within the virtual twin model in near-real time. A realistic model of the natural environment will provide new virtual opportunities to test and improve our understanding of these systems and to model and predict their behaviors into the future.\nCGI renewal – Mark Rattenbury As an illustration of planning and renewal, Mark, a CGI Councilor, discussed how CGI has initiated draft steps toward renewal. He described how the Commission for the Management and Application of Geoscience Information (CGI) is a Commission of the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS), and is an international scientific, technical non-governmental, non-political, and non-profit-making organization.\nMark then outlined how CGI aims to: help in exchanging knowledge on geoscience information and systems; support dissemination of best practice in geoscience information; encourage the development of geoscience information standards; play a full part in the international geoscience information community and represent IUGS on geoscience information matters; bring together individuals and organizations with an interest in the management and application of geoscience information; and provide open access to the standards and outputs it delivers, for the benefit of all.\nHe then noted that CGI: has been very successful and influential since its inception; has worked widely across the international community; has led with development of the GeoSciML and EarthResourceML data; has led model standards for information transfer with publishing of internationally agreed geoscience vocabularies; and continues to support these and other initiatives such as OGC\u0026rsquo;s Geoscience Domain Working Group and IUGS\u0026rsquo;s Deep-time Digital Earth.\nHe further described how CGI collaborates on focused projects; provides continuity between peaks in project activities; and offers trusted, stable and enduring governance capability to the geoscience information community.\nHe then suggested that CGI should: assess the maturity of current geoscience information standards; identify opportunities that lie ahead in the geoscience information standards domain; signal what could be achieved in the next four years; signal what could be achieved in the next ten years; and identify collaborators and resources that could help achieve the goals.\nGeoInfo Summit discussion session – Harvey Thorleifson The 90-minute GeoInfo Summit discussion session on May 19th at 10 UTC was a great success. Partner organization leaders noted that technical challenges cannot be addressed by a single organization. We need to address societal challenges, to attract young people, and to work efficiently. Leaders stressed the importance of concrete products. We emphasized the need for a shared vision that we all can rally around.\nWe asserted that we need to be needed, by making sure that our activity is relevant, in part by utilizing new capabilities. We stressed sustainability of our activity, and efficiency through coordination. We stated that standards are maintained if used, and we need to find a problem that calls for what we do. We thus saw the need for a community that uses what we do, with standards reaching critical mass. We then talked about how to go forward. We noted that in-person meetings allow serendipity, social interaction, and meeting people. We then focused on a global solid earth digital twin as a focal point, perhaps to be a highlight of upcoming IUGS meetings. We saw that we need a workshop that reaches conclusions. We understand that we need a goal, for initial delivery at the IGC in 2024.\nIt was noted that a global solid earth digital twin would be inclusive of everyone, under a ‘Save the Planet’ sort of banner that attracts young people, for very legitimate reasons. We discussed the concurrent digital twin of the oceans, and there was mention of soil/geology coordination. We recognized that we should not promise something by a date, or stress that major funding should come first – but rather we need a roadmap for what each organization needs to do.\nIn closing, Harvey Thorleifson noted that we are operating as a multi-agency network, so each agency would have to respect its governance. He suggested that we plan for additional multi-agency, online meetings in September, to take the next step in bringing the solid earth digital twin concept into focus, for example in coordination with DDE.\nFuture Events On September 20-21, 2022, for 90 minutes each day at 10 UTC, we will hold GeoInfo Summit Follow-Up, to be attended by leaders of global geoscience information organizations.\nIf you wish to attend, please contact the CGI Chair at thorleif@umn.edu.\n","date":1662301140,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662301140,"objectID":"61a1abf311776adcffdfee7169deebca","permalink":"https://cgi-iugs.github.io/post/newsletter-issue-8/","publishdate":"2022-09-04T14:19:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/newsletter-issue-8/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome to Edition #8 of the CGI Newsletter.

The goal of CGI is to foster the interoperability and exchange of geoscience information, through community leadership, collaboration, education, as well as development and promotion of standards and best practices.\nOn 23 June 2021, from 10 AM to Noon UTC, CGI hosted a webinar attended by 91 experts from around the world.\nCGI Webinar participants\nHarvey Thorleifson, Director of the Minnesota Geological Survey in the USA and CGI Chair, indicated that the objective of the webinar was to share updates on the work that CGI is carrying out with partners, and to hear discussion. He thanked partners who were mentioned in the six presentations that followed. Discussion and feedback indicated that the webinar was a great success. Videos are available on YouTube.\nFuture Events On September 9, 2021, at 10 UTC, we will hold an informal technical seminar on geoscience ontology and knowledge graph, to be attended by members and friends of relevant working groups of CGI and partner organisations. If you wish to attend, please contact the CGI Chair at mailto:thorleif@umn.edu.\nOGC Geoscience Domain – Mickaël Beaufils Mickael Beaufils of BRGM spoke as Chair of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Geoscience Domain Working Group (DWG), that partners with CGI and many other organizations in making spatial information findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR).\nFor findability, he cited persistent identifiers (PIDs), rich metadata, indexed data repositories, and PIDs in metadata; for accessibility, he cited standard communication protocols, open and free protocols, authentication where necessary, and metadata always available; for interoperability, he cited vocabularies, FAIR vocabularies, and linked metadata; and for reusability, he cited multiple attribute metadata, usage licenses, provenance, and community standards.\nKey DWG goals are: interoperability, data definitions, formats, and services for publishing, search, and exchange; thematic/semantic coherence with related domains; interfaces with city/infrastructure and risk domains; showing value added by interoperability; best practices; and standards for spatial and temporal features, metadata, and other information.\nEmphasis has been on the BhML borehole conceptual model, as well as (Geo)JSON(- LD), 3D-4D, BIM, geotechnics, ISO19156 for observations and measurements, OGC SensorThings API, OGC-API features, and SMART Data Loader.\nThe DWG has been active since being conceived at Dublin in 2016; the next meeting is in September.\nGeoSciML – Éric Boisvert Éric Boisvert of the Geological Survey of Canada spoke on behalf of the OGC Standard Working Group (SWG) for GeoSciML (Geoscience Markup Language), an XML- and GML-based machine-readable format for geological maps that has been stable for almost two decades since emanating from work such as XMML, NADM, and G-XML. Although V1 in 2005 was monolithic, V2 in 2009 had properties grouped, with boreholes and fossils added.\nV3 in 2012 was packaged as 13 schemas, with themes added, OGC versions of some dependencies, custom elements dropped, external vocabularies, and explicit nil required. V4 in 2015, packaged as basic and extended, became OGC V4.1 in 2017, with reversion to optional properties, profiling, and Portrayal (Lite) integrated. The scope covers geology, including boreholes and specimens, with limited applicability to specialized domains, or symbology.\nGeoSciML Lite, based on simple features and thus comparable to a SHP file, is widely compatible, although with limited expressiveness, and thus limited to simple applications. Extensions include GroundwaterML2, EarthResourceML, and geotechnics for civil engineering. OGC, and thus GeoSciML, is transitioning from XML to JSON (OGC API); future work will address knowledge encoding such as RDF and ontologies.\nEarthResourceML – Michael Sexton Michael Sexton of Geoscience Australia provided an overview of EarthResourceML (ERML), a markup language for the delivery of mineral occurrence, deposit, mining, and resource data that was initiated in 2006 as a collaboration between Australian state and federal agencies. The name was adopted and a CGI working group formed in 2010.\nERML is an extension of GeoSciML, with a mineral occurrence being a subtype of Geologic Feature; the mining feature types of ERML are not part of GeoSciML.\nThe earth resource concept encompasses geology, economics, environment, and society. Through international collaboration, ERML has a minimum set of features and attributes for describing and communicating information about earth resources in a standardized way. Nineteen CGI vocabularies include mine status, commodity, and reserves; data delivery and implementation are well accommodated.\nERML v3, which is near completion, has an improved resources model to represent resources as reported, addition of processing plants, and removal of mandatory attributes and relationships. ERML v3 will have GeoServer feature templating and a smart data loader, with JSON outputs.\nCGI Geoscience Vocabularies – Mark Rattenbury Mark Rattenbury of GNS Science in New Zealand, Te Pū Ao, spoke for the CGI Geoscience Terminology Working Group, which has been separate from the GeoSciML group since 2014, and which maintain lists of terms for earth features, properties, quantities, techniques, and processes that are collaboratively agreed upon and are widely accessible, including to machines. The terminology conveys unambiguous meaning, offers translations, reduces confusion, utilizes natural hierarchies, and supports data models.\nThe Working Group supports interoperability, develops and enables vocabularies, has 30 members in 16 countries, collaborates with partner groups, has had six face-to-face meetings, and has had much online interaction. A formal vocabulary development and adoption process is used. The vocabularies are somewhat FAIR, but there are many competing vocabularies. Ideally, CGI vocabularies will be better known and more widely used, because they are international, they support data models, and they are supported through enduring governance. Working Group priorities are to publish remaining vocabularies identified by working groups, update published vocabularies, add multilingual terms, and promote application of CGI vocabularies, especially in academic and industry contexts.\nChallenges include aligning to international projects, finding time to make progress, and pandemic-related restrictions on travel.\nLoop GeoScience Ontology – Boyan Brodaric and Stephen Richard Boyan Brodaric of the Geological Survey of Canada, and Stephen Richard of the USGIN Foundation in USA, reported on GeoScience Ontology (GSO) research being conducted in association with Loop, an integrated and interoperable platform enabling 3D stochastic geological modeling. Knowledge management at present is a very active topic, due to the activities of Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and others. The Google Knowledge Graph initially released in 2016, the basis for their infobox, is built on a schema.org ontology, and a query API such as SPARQL.\nThe GSO incorporates a framework with entities, relations, and rules, as well as an OWL2 language. The GSO builds on NADM, GeoSciML, and DOLCE Rocks, and work in several ongoing projects. In association with GeoSciML, the activity includes, for example, an OWL conceptual schema and re-conceptualization, UML logical schema, XSD application schema, and XML instance documents.\nDevelopment will have to be broad and deep, modular, and standalone. The modular organization will be a layercake ontology, from common, to geology, to modules. Context dependency is an important concept, and relations include fundamental, spatial, temporal, and geological. Next steps include public feedback, knowledge repository testing, and integration with Loop 3D modeling code.\nDDE Standards Task Group – Zhang Minghua Zhang Minghua of the China Geological Survey, Co-Secretary General of CGI, described the work of the Deep-time Digital Earth Standards Task Group (DDE-STG). DDE is an IUGS big science program focused on data-driven discovery regarding the evolution of life, matter, geography, and climate. DDE will be an international consortium that will link databases, make data FAIR, unify earth science, and promote research.\nThe kickoff meeting at Beijing in February 2019 was attended by representatives of 40 geoscience organizations, and founding organizations signed an accord. The DDE roadmap encompasses the 2019 accord, formal launch in 2020, midterm reporting in 2024, and final reporting in 2028. For the geoscience knowledge system, DDE has adopted CGI terminology, and knowledge system graphs have been in development since 2019.\nThe DDE-STG, now consisting of 28 leading professionals who held their first in-person meeting in January 2020, will now work in close collaboration with CGI and partners such as CODATA, to coordinate standards identification and development, survey stakeholders, develop the metadata standard based on ISO19115-2014(E), oversee review of the semantic knowledge system, provide advice to DDE working groups, provide training, and maintain the portfolio of standards.\nJoin Us Please visit the CGI web site at https://cgi-iugs.org/, and if you aren’t a member, please click the Join Now button!\n","date":1628864340,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628864340,"objectID":"3a505c20238fdc2f0469fc53bbd687fc","permalink":"https://cgi-iugs.github.io/post/newsletter-issue-7/","publishdate":"2021-08-13T14:19:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/newsletter-issue-7/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome to Edition #7 of the CGI Newsletter.

EarthResourceML (ERML) is an XML-based data transfer standard for the exchange of digital information for mineral occurrences, mines and mining activity. EarthResourceML describes the geological characteristics and setting of mineral occurrences, their contained commodities and their mineral resource and reserve endowment. It is also able to describe mines and mining activities, and production of concentrates, refined product and waste materials.\nEarthResourceML makes use of the existing GeoSciML data standard for describing geological materials associated with mineral deposits. It is also underpinned by established OGC and ISO standards, including web feature service (WFS - ISO 19142), geography markup language (GML - ISO 19136), and SWE Common.\nA parallel data standard for simple visualisation, EarthResourceML-Lite (ERML Lite), has also been developed. It enables the portrayal of a simplified set of the ERML data model using web map services (WMS) or simple web feature services (WFS).\nExample uses:\n \n \n \nHistory of EarthResourceML EarthResourceML (ERML) was born from a model developed by the Australian Government Geoscience Information Committee (GGIC) from 2004–2008. The CGI took over governance of the Australian model in 2008, and, after modifications by the CGI Interoperability Working Group, EarthResourceML version 1.1 was published in 2009. After some further revision, mainly to accommodate the needs of the European INSPIRE Directive, EarthResourceML version 2.0 was published in 2013.\nFuture development of ERML, and the simple-feature variant of ERML (ERML Lite), which supports simple portrayal requirements (e.g. WMS), will be undertaken by the EarthResourceML Working Group.\nERML Lite version 1.0 was published in 2016 and the current version (2.0) was accepted in 2017 and published in 2018.\nThe international ERML development team meets at least annually to ensure that ERML continues to address the needs of data providers and users.

Why do we need GeoSciML?  History of GeoSciML  Downloads and Other Resources  GeoSciML Standards Working Group  Global Use of GeoSciML   Join the GeoSciML team\nWhat is GeoSciML GeoSciML is an XML–based data transfer standard for the exchange of digital geoscientific information. It accommodates the representation and description of features typically found on geological maps, as well as being extensible to other geoscience data such as drilling, sampling, and analytical data.\nGeoSciML provides a standard data structure for a suite of common geologic features (eg, geologic units, structures, earth materials) and artefacts of geological investigations (eg, boreholes, specimens, measurements). Supporting objects such as the geologic timescale and vocabularies are also provided as linked resources, so that they can be used as classifiers for the primary objects in the GeoSciML standard.\nThe GeoSciML data standard is underpinned by several established OGC and ISO standards, including Web Feature Service (WFS – ISO 19142), Geography Markup Language (GML – ISO 19136), Observations \u0026amp; Measurements (O\u0026amp;M – ISO 19156), and SWE Common.\nA parallel data standard for simple map visualisation, GeoSciML-Portrayal, has also been developed. It enables portrayal of a small simplified subset of the GeoSciML data model using Web Map Services (WMS) or simple Web Feature Services (WFS).\nWhy do we need GeoSciML Users of geoscience maps and data know that geological features have no respect for national or provincial borders. Inevitably users of geoscience data will need to source data from more than one data provider. Receiving data in a number of local data formats is recognised as a major impediment to efficient and effective use of data.\nGeoSciML seeks to provide a single, open source, globally agreed data structure that is used to deliver digital geological data over the internet. Additionally, the use of agreed vocabularies of geoscience terminology provides consistency in the semantic language used across geological datasets. Data providers do not need to change their internal databases to match the GeoSciML structure, but instead translate their data to the GeoSciML structure at the point of delivery.\nHistory of GeoSciML The GeoSciML project was initiated in 2003 under the auspices of the CGI Working Group on Data Model Collaboration. The project was incorporated into the newly formed CGI Interoperability Working Group in 2004. In 2013, development of GeoSciML was moved to the current GeoSciML Standards Working Group, a collaboration between the CGI and the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).\nA number of predecessor projects from North America, Europe, Australia and Asia have had a strong influence on the development of GeoSciML. These include activities undertaken within national statutory bodies (eg, British and Japanese Geological Surveys), in multi-jurisdictional contexts (eg, the North American Data Model for geological maps) or oriented to an industry sector (eg, the Australian Exploration and Mining Markup Language - XMML).\nThe international GeoSciML development team meets at least annually to ensure that GeoSciML continues to address the needs of data providers and users. Most recent meetings have been held in St Petersburg (2013), Tuscon (2014), Ispra (2015), Dublin (2016) and Vienna (2017).\nDownloads and Other Resources   www.geosciml.org — Documentation, cookbooks, UML models, examples, and XML schemas for GeoSciML and GeoSciML-Portrayal.  schemas.geosciml.org — XML schemas for GeoSciML and GeoSciML-Portrayal.  resource.geosciml.org — Geoscience vocabularies to support the GeoSciML data model, developed by the CGI Geoscience Terminology Working group and its predecessors.

The US Geoscience Information Network is using GeoSciML-Portrayal and GeoSciML to share geological data between government agencies, educational and private institutions. The Canadian Groundwater Information Network uses an extension of GeoSciML – GroundwaterML – to integrate water well information from multiple jurisdictions. The Australian Geoscience Information Network and AuScope projects are using GeoSciML to deliver borehole data from Australian state and territory agencies.

The GTWG manages these vocabularies and their associated documentation for use in geoscience information systems, in particular for the GeoSciML and EarthResourceML data transfer standards. The group assesses proposals for new geoscience vocabularies and change requests for existing CGI vocabularies. GTWG also liaises with other semantic interoperability groups to ensure cross-domain interoperability and promotes the use of vocabularies for enhanced dataset interoperability.\nOur vocabularies More than 100 geoscience vocabularies have been identified to support the GeoSciML and EarthResourceML data models and over 50 of these have now been compiled and adopted. These are available through the CGI vocabularies register. These vocabularies include key lists such as:\n lithology\n265 lithological rock names, hierarchically organised around up to six levels e.g. tholeiitic basalt, basalt, basic igneous rock, basic igneous material, igneous material, compound material\n resource commodity types\n293 types of earth-sourced commodity, hierarchically organised around up to six levels e.g. anthracite, coal, carbonaceous material, organic material, industrial material, direct use commodity\n nature of rock unit contacts\n36 types of geological contacts, hierarchically organised around up to five levels, e.g. angular unconformable contact, unconformable contact, depositional contact, lithogenetic contact, contact\n borehole drilling method\n30 types of drilling technology, hierarchically organised around up to three levels e.g. gravity core, direct push, core drilling\nThe important CGI geological time vocabulary service will be merged into the main CGI vocabularies register in the near future. The geological time vocabulary draws on age definitions established by the International Commission on Stratigraphy and was the first CGI vocabulary to provide multi-lingual terms, currently in 19 languages.\nThe CGI vocabulary service is hosted by the Australian National Data Service and is administered through Geoscience Australia. Additional resources are available from the Research Vocabularies Australia website, including downloadable code-lists in Resource Description Framework (RDF) formats (e.g. RDF/XML, JSON, Turtle) and Linked Data APIs.\nBackground The CGI has had two previous workgroups involved in vocabulary production. The Multi-lingual Thesaurus Working Group was formed in 2003 to continue work of the Multhes working group of the 1990s. The Concept Definition Task Group was formed by the CGI Interoperability Working Group in 2007 to develop concept vocabularies for populating GeoSciML interchange documents. Because of the overlapping interests the CGI council has determined that it will be more efficient and effective to merge the efforts. The Geoscience Terminology Working Group was established early in 2013 to undertake this combined role.\nWhy are vocabularies needed? Vocabularies are restricted lists of agreed terms that describe features contained in database fields. By limiting database values to the contents of common agreed vocabularies the interoperability and interchange of the information is enhanced. The list contents are also multi-lingual where translations of the originating list language are made available in other languages. Vocabularies also organise their terms hierarchically so that terms can be parts of a group that is a valid term itself. For example \u0026ldquo;basalt\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;gabbroic rock\u0026rdquo; are narrower adopted CGI terms for the broader level \u0026ldquo;basic igneous rock\u0026rdquo;. and this enables database searching or map portrayal based on either the broader or the narrower term.\nHow vocabularies are adopted Proposals for new geoscience vocabularies or change requests for existing CGI vocabularies, are lodged with the GTWG, usually instigated from within the group but can be initiated from outside for a specific requirement. Each proposal is assessed by the group to establish whether the changes are minor and do not require the GTWG\u0026rsquo;s formal consultation, review and adoption process or whether the proposed changes are significant and need input from the group. Each new or changed vocabulary proposal is assigned a \u0026lsquo;shepherd\u0026rsquo; responsible for developing a draft vocabulary if new, or modifying a version of an existing vocabulary. The vocabulary proposal is then reviewed by the GTWG and through them colleagues and the wider community. After consultation and response to comments, the shepherd recommends voting for its adoption to the GTWG. Upon adoption, the vocabulary is registered in the CGI vocabulary repository.\nInitial vocabulary development typically begins with a spreadsheet compilation of candidate terms using Excel and Google Sheets shared spreadsheets on the GTWG Google Drive facility. When a vocabulary has been completed, reviewed and adopted, it is migrated into SKOS, an RDF application for encoding concepts with identifiers, definitions, source information, standard thesaurus type relationships, and language-localized labels. The RDF-encoded file is then migrated on to the vocabulary server, for example the commodity code vocabulary.\nHow to lodge a Request for Change A Request for Change refers to a proposal to modify an adopted existing CGI vocabulary or to propose a new geoscience vocabulary. The GTWG recognise that the adopted vocabularies will not always suit all user requirements and that needs of the wider geoscience community will evolve. Adopted vocabularies should be regarded as live working versions rather than irrevocably finalised. The GTWG will consider a Request for Change from groups or individuals outside of the working group. These Requests for Change can be sent to the working group via an email request to chair.gtwg@gmail.com. Alternatively a Request for Change can be sent to a GTWG member directly.\nMembership The GTWG contains members from all over the world. The current membership of 27 includes representatives from geological surveys of Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, New Zealand, Russia, Slovenia, Sweden and USA.\nThe GTWG needs active participation in the construction of geoscience vocabularies. Participants with expertise in specialist geoscience domains, information science and data models are particularly welcomed. For those who would like to contribute to the GTWG should contact the Chair, outlining their areas of expertise and their capacity to assist.\n","date":1560336603,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560336603,"objectID":"655e26b95cb804a803c91fe81d502c82","permalink":"https://cgi-iugs.github.io/project/geoscienceterminology/","publishdate":"2019-06-12T11:50:03+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/geoscienceterminology/","section":"project","summary":"A CGI working group developing and publishing multi-lingual geoscience vocabularies","tags":["active"],"title":"Geoscience Terminology Working Group (GTWG)","type":"project"},{"authors":["CGI-IUGS"],"categories":["news"],"content":" EarthResourceML-Lite is a data model and schema for simple map services (e.g. WMS and WFS Simple Features).

The process for application and election of CGI Councillors starts several months in advance of the CGI General Assembly and is described below.\nThe Application Process Call for Applications Applications for Council will be received for a period of 1 month after the call for applications which will be posted on the CGI web site and circulated to CGI members by email.\nApplication Requirements  Applicants must be CGI members. Applicants must have substantial expertise in the management and dissemination of digital geoscience data in corporate environment and a strong motivation to contribute. Applicants must be able to communicate orally in English and have experience as participants in international collaborative team environments. Applicants must be able to verify that they will be active in taking forward the work of CGI and supported to attend at least the annual meeting of the CGI Council.  Application Process Members wishing to stand for election for Council must prepare a letter of application (in English) to the Secretary General and Chair where they outline how they meet the application requirements and :\n Expertise and experience relative to the CGI mandate and activities. Their motivation to contribute to the CGI The region(s) they work in and have experience (Africa, Asia \u0026amp; Oceania, North America, Latin \u0026amp; South America, Europe; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Geography) Identify leadership and participation in collaborative international, regional, or specialist groups relevant to the mandate and operation of CGI. The source of funding for travel expenses to attend CGI meetings. Send applications to CGIsecretariat@geo-zs.si  Review of Applicants by CGI Council The CGI Council will review the applications based on the criteria outlined above and select a maximum of 30 applicants to stand for election for the 12 possible Council positions. A principal objective of the selection process will be to identify a group of applicants with diverse and complementary expertise and regional affiliation. In the case of Council members standing for re-election, their contribution and meeting attendance during the current term will be amongst the factors considered.\nThe Election Process  CGI members will be emailed by the Secretary General voting instructions and a list of candidates and asked to vote for a maximum of 12 councillors. Four weeks will be allowed for voting. Approximately 2 months before the annual General Assembly at the International Geological Congress, the identity of all selected candidates will be put on the CGI Website accompanied by a brief description of their background and skills. New CGI members who join CGI after this date will not be permitted to participate in this election process. At the end of the voting period, the CGI Council will compile the votes and identify the successful candidates. To fill the geographical requirement and ensure that all regions of the world are represented, a minimum of 1, and a maximum of 4 candidates, will be selected from each of the 5 identified geographic regions of the globe. This will be achieved by choosing an initial candidate with the most votes for every one of the 5 regions, then the other candidates will be selected according to the number of votes they have obtained, with a limit of 4 per region. The successful candidates will be contacted by email to request that they confirm in writing that they will have support of their agencies to participate in CGI Council activities and attend annual CGI Council meetings. Upon receipt of confirmation of support, the new Council will be announced to CGI members and the IUGS Secretariat by email; and also posted on the CGI website approximately 2 months in advance of the IGC.  Selection of the CGI Council Chair, Secretary General, and Treasurer. The new Council will meet and take over from the old Council at the IGC and agree who will take on the specific roles of CGI Council Chair, Secretary General, and Treasurer. The result will be announced to CGI members and the IUGS Secretariat by email; and also posted on the CGI website.\n","date":1530144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530144000,"objectID":"54ce711f321d37dfeca53a6a622e9343","permalink":"https://cgi-iugs.github.io/misc/councilapp/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/misc/councilapp/","section":"misc","summary":"Procedure for the Election of CGI Council Members","tags":null,"title":"Council Elections","type":"misc"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Commission Documents CGI annual reports to the IUGS   2018  2017  Four year report 2012-16  2016  2015  2014  2013  2012  Four year report 2008-11  2011  2010  2009  2008  Four year report 2004-07  2007  2006  2005  2004  Other CGI documents   CGI statutes  CGI Council Meeting Minutes   Please login to view council minutes  ","date":1530144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530144000,"objectID":"1c191531f2e5aa66e4a57ca7dc3735aa","permalink":"https://cgi-iugs.github.io/misc/reports/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/misc/reports/","section":"misc","summary":"Commission Documents CGI annual reports to the IUGS   2018  2017  Four year report 2012-16  2016  2015  2014  2013  2012  Four year report 2008-11  2011  2010  2009  2008  Four year report 2004-07  2007  2006  2005  2004  Other CGI documents   CGI statutes  CGI Council Meeting Minutes   Please login to view council minutes  ","tags":null,"title":"Reports","type":"misc"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Standards CGI-developed data standards   GeoSciML  EarthResourceML  OGC data standards   Full list of OGC standards XML encoding standards that support GeoSciML and EarthResourceML   Geography Markup Language (GML) - also published as ISO 19136  Observations \u0026amp;

In this edition we report on the progress of the CGI Working Groups and the recent meetings of CGI members.\nTable of Contents  A Busy Time for CGI GeoSciML Standards Working Group Towards a New Version of ERML Geoscience Vocabularies News from Asia  CCOP Workshop on IGDP and Compilation Technology Information Sharing for the \u0026lsquo;Belt and Route Region\u0026rsquo;   News from South America  Ibero-American Open Science Meeting in Buenos Aires   CGI Standards in New Zealand CGI Council News 32nd Annual GIC Conference Upcoming Events  Resources for Future Generations — Vancouver, June 2018   Meet Your CGI Councillors Featured Project Join Us on LinkedIn   A Busy Time for CGI May and June was a busy time for many CGI members. Three of CGI\u0026rsquo;s standards working groups, the CGI Council, the OneGeology Technical Implementation Group, and the 32nd annual Geoscience Information Consortium (GIC) conference all met over a period of two weeks in Vienna, Austria and Orleans, France.\nGeoSciML Standards Working Group The OGC/CGI GeoSciML Standards Working Group (SWG) held its annual face-to-face meeting at Geologische Bundesanstalt (Geological Survey of Austria) in Vienna in May. This was the first meeting since the GeoSciML v4.1 data standard was ratified and published by OGC in March. All current documentation and schemas are now hosted on the OGC website. The original CGI website still maintains access to all historic versions of GeoSciML and links to other supporting resources like UML models and vocabularies.\nAfter 8 years as Chair of the Working Group, Ollie Raymond stepped down and Eric Boisvert (pictured) from the Geological Survey of Canada has taken on the role. We wish Eric and the team every success as the SWG enters a new phase in GeoSciML development. The working group discussed minor corrections to the version 4.1 standard, considered a GML version 3.2 profile of GeoSciML-Lite, and reviewed the best practice of delivering data using the GeoSciML-Lite data standard.\nMembers also considered the future direction of the SWG, in particular towards potential new standard encodings of the GeoSciML data model, such as RDF and JSON.\nTowards a New Version of ERML The annual EarthResourceML (ERML) Working Group meeting was held in June in Orleans, France, hosted by BRGM. CGI members from France, Finland, Australia and New Zealand attended the one day meeting.\nThe working group discussed a proposal from Geoscience Australia for a modification to way that the ERML-Lite data standard delivers commodity resource and reserve amounts. This request was based on the Australian and New Zealand experience of recently establishing the world\u0026rsquo;s first ERML-Lite WFS services.\nThe EU-funded ProSum project also presented a proposal to extend the ERML full model. The proposal will add Processing Activity and Processing Plant to the model. Other technical changes, including links to GeoSciML v4 and implementing recent GeoSciML modelling patterns, will be added to the EarthResourceML and after a review and voting period, a new version ERML v 3.0 will be published later in 2017.\nCGI intends to have a strong presence at the RFG2018 conference in Vancouver in June 2018, in particular to promote ERML and ERML-Lite to North America. New ERML and ERML-Lite implementations and use cases will be demonstrated there. Documentation and schemas for EarthResourceML v2.0 and EarthResourceML-Lite v1.0 are available on the www.earthresourceml.org website.\nGeoscience Vocabularies The CGI Geoscience Terminology Working Group (GTWG) met for its fourth face-to-face meeting at the Geological Survey of Austria in Vienna on May 26. Twenty-two people participated in person or remotely. Several key vocabularies that are in advanced stages of preparation have been prioritised for completion, notably the Natural Geomorphologic Feature, Mineral Deposit Type and Regional Lithological Unit Synthesis vocabularies.\nA presentation by Chris Schubert from the Austrian Climate Change Centre outlined development on federated registries of vocabularies in Europe, and has helped confirm that GTWG’s role in providing globally-relevant geoscience terms that can work in parallel with geological surveys’ more local vocabulary requirements.\n \nThe CGI Vocabulary Service, hosted by Australia’s CSIRO for around a decade, is in the process of being moved to its new hosting organisation, Geoscience Australia. As part of the move to new hosting arrangements, all 2016 editions of CGI\u0026rsquo;s vocabularies are also incorporated in the Research Vocabularies Australia vocabulary service, a broader science vocabularies service that is available online globally.\nNews from Asia CCOP Workshop on IGDP and Compilation Technology A cooperation project between China and the Southeast Asia Geoscience Program Coordinating Committee (CCOP) on Integrated Geological Data Processing (IGDP) was kicked off at a workshop hosted by the China Geological Survey (CGS) on 22–24 May in Beijing.\nThe workshop included training for CCOP member countries on data processing techniques for geological, geophysical and geochemical data. Twenty participants from Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam and the CCOP Technical Secretariat joined a discussion on OneGeology geological map data delivery technologies, and regional geoscience map compilation techniques. A work plan for the next two years was prepared.\nInformation Sharing for the \u0026lsquo;Belt and Route Region\u0026rsquo; A seminar was held at the China Geological Survey in Beijing on 16–20 May, 2017, aimed at geoscience information sharing amongst the vast region of the so-called the \u0026lsquo;Belt and Route Region\u0026rsquo;. The region, coined by the Chinese government, covers part or all of Oceania, Asia, Europe, Arab and Africa. More than 50 officials and experts from different geological organisations exchanged views and shared current technology for data exchange and information sharing. CGI-IUGS standards and the CCOP metadata standard will be used for data transfer once the cooperation project application is approved by the Chinese government.\nNews from South America Ibero-American Open Science Meeting in Buenos Aires An international Seminar on Open Science was held in Buenos Aires, Argentina from May 31 to June 2. The seminar was organised under the auspices of the Ibero-American States Organizations, Portugal, Uruguay, and the Argentina Ministry of Science and Technology. Science, technology and innovation agencies from Spain, Brasil and Colombia also participated.\nThe seminar discussed \u0026lsquo;Open Science\u0026rsquo; to enable collaborative research and knowledge distribution by digital means. In particular, the regional science community see it as a way to improve science and technology development and performance in South America.\nThe meeting was focused mainly on open digital repositories. In this context, not only will written publications be reviewed, but also their supporting data and results. It is hoped that in the future this initial step by Latin American countries will facilitate the access to and development of interoperable data and methods for any kind of scientific data. The regional science community intends to facilitiate the development of initiatives currently occurring at different levels and domains in international organisations like IUGS CGI, ICSU, and the Research Data Alliance.\nCGI Standards in New Zealand GNS Science, the New Zealand government geoscience agency, is just one example of a data provider embracing CGI data standards.\nAs mentioned in the EarthResourceML news above, an EarthResourceML-Lite-compliant web service of New Zealand\u0026rsquo;s mineral occurrences is available (see gns:GERM_ERML_VIEW). Two New Zealand geological map datasets — the 1:1M Geological map of New Zealand and the 1:250k Geological Map of Southern Victoria Land (Antarctica) — are now available as GeoSciML Lite-compliant web services, have been accredited with 4-star OneGeology status, and can be accessed from the GNS web service interface. The layers include links to CGI codelists for age terms, unit types, representative lithology and metadata records.\nThe 2017 version of the QMAP 1:250 000 Geological Map of New Zealand seamless GIS dataset contains links to CGI code-lists for age terms, unit types, representative lithology and metadata records amongst others. New Zealand’s Petlab Geoanalytical Database of rock and mineral properties has also incorporated CGI vocabulary terms for rock names and geological age.\nCGI Council News The CGI Council held its 2017 annual meeting in Vienna in June.\nThe councillors addressed:\n activities for CGI funding in 2017–18 planning for the RFG 2018 conference in Vancouver next year a proposal for the coordination of hydrogeology data standards development in CGI and OGC the need to recruit and rejuvenate active membership in CGI working groups better promotion of CGI activities and standards  32nd Annual GIC Conference The Geoscience Information Consortium (GIC) is an annual gathering of information managers from international government Geological Survey agencies. The 32nd GIC Conference was held from May 29 to June 3 at the Geological Survey of Austria (GBA) in Vienna. Many CGI members attended, and shared their work with Geological Survey representatives from 35 countries from every continent.\nThe conference heard a wide range of presentations on current best practice in data management and data delivery from many individual Geological Surveys, as well as collaborative data sharing initiatives from around the world. Panel discussion sessions also shared the experiences and requirements of the Geological Surveys in managing and delivering 3D geological models, future data management strategies, and emerging technologies.\nGovernment Geological Survey information managers are encouraged to join the 33rd annual GIC conference which will be hosted by Geoscience Australia in Canberra, Australia in mid 2018.\nUpcoming Events Resources for Future Generations — Vancouver, June 2018 CGI cordially invites its members to the RFG 2018 conference in Vancouver, Canada, 16–21 June 2018. IUGS is a partner organisation at this conference and CGI encourages all its members to at the conference to demonstrate how CGI\u0026rsquo;s standards and best practice in data delivery and analysis supports and enables sustainable resource discovery and exploitation. It is anticipated that the use of web service data delivery, in particular using the EarthResourceML and EarthResourceML-Lite data transfer standards, will be a feature. The conference will be a forum for industry stakeholders to discuss their research initiatives and activities as well as the key issues and trends shaping the future of energy, minerals and water resources.\nMeet Your CGI Councillors Dr Zhang Minghua is co-Secretary General of CGI and Director of Geoinformation and Engineering at the Development Research Center of the China Geological Survey.

This significant milestone cements GeoSciML\u0026rsquo;s place as the international geological data transfer standard.\nDocumentation and schemas for GeoSciML version 4.1 will be available on the OGC and www.geosciml.org websites early in 2017. Due to some changes required by the OGC review process, GeoSciML will move from version 4.0 to version 4.1. The most significant change in version 4.1 is the renaming of GeoSciML-Portrayal to GeoSciML-Lite to avoid confusion with use of the word \u0026lsquo;portrayal\u0026rsquo; in other standards domains. The only other changes from version 4.0 to 4.1 are minor bug fixes and improvements to documentation.\nThe considerable documentation required for OGC accreditation was compiled by Eric Boisvert of the Geological Survey of Canada, with assistance from Ollie Raymond (Geoscience Australia) and Marcus Sen (British Geological Survey). Many thanks for a great effort!\nEarthResourceML-Lite A new abridged, simple feature (WFS SF-0) version of the EarthResourceML data model was released by CGI in August 2016. EarthResourceML-Lite (or ERML-Lite) can be used to deliver simplified views on mineral occurrences and their commodities, mines, mining activities and mine waste products.\nERML-Lite has a similar purpose to GeoSciML-Lite, in that it enables delivery of a simplified view of the full EarthResourceML model which can be used for exchange of data in simple formats that can be easily rendered in GIS applications and web mapping portals (e.g., WMS, simple WFS, shapefiles, CSV tables).\n2016 IUGS Science Excellence Award Dr Stephen Richard, recently of the Arizona Geological Survey and now at Columbia University, USA, was awarded the 2016 IUGS Science Excellence Award in Geoscience Information at the 35th Intern-ational Geological Congress.\nSteve was a research geologist and Head of Geoinformatics at the Arizona Geological Survey from 1992 until 2016, but his influence on North American and international geoinformatics extends way beyond the borders of Arizona. Steve was a leading member of the North American Geological Map Data Model (NADM) Steering Committee from 2000 to 2007. He worked with this consortium of American and Canadian geoscientists, database designers, and developers of geologic map information to develop a comprehensive geological data model that would form one of the foundations for global standards development.\nSteve was a founding member of the CGI Interoperability Working Group in 2004. As part of this group, Steve was a leading force for over 10 years in the development of the GeoSciML standard for geoscience data transfer.\nSteve has also been deeply involved in development of international geoscience vocabularies through the IUGS CGI Controlled Vocabularies Working Group, and was the founding Chair of the CGI Geoscience Terminology Working Group. Over 30 internationally-agreed vocabularies were published under Steve\u0026rsquo;s leadership.\nSteve has also been a leader in technical development of the US Geoscience Information Network (USGIN) - especially as chief architect of the US National Geothermal Data System - to deploy web services for geoscience information exchange. His advocacy of OGC and CGI standards in US geological surveys has led to these global standards being embedded in North American data delivery best practice.\nGeoscience Vocabularies The Geoscience Terminology Working Group (GTWG) has been working away compiling key vocabularies to support the GeoSciML and EarthResourceML geoscience data models. The CGI vocabulary service has been hosted by CSIRO in Australia from its inception, but is soon to be migrated onto a server hosted by Geoscience Australia. The GTWG is very appreciative of the efforts of CSIRO in developing and maintaining the vocabulary service for over a decade and thanks Geoscience Australia for agreeing to support the service into the future.\nThe important Commodity Code vocabulary was compiled and adopted in 2015; a highly hierarchically organised vocabulary of 291 terms describing natural and processed earth resource commodities. This vocabulary is showcased in the Minerals4EU Map Viewer web application for mineral commodities around Europe.\nThe EarthResourceML vocabularies have been translated into 22 other European languages through the INSPIRE directive and these multi-lingual vocabularies will be adapted for delivery through the CGI vocabulary service. Many more vocabularies are still required, particularly for the Extension schema of the GeoSciML model.\nThe Working Group is always looking for more active members to contribute to compilation of geoscience vocabularies, particularly in languages other than English.

As a result of this there has been a considerable amount of effort put into developing metadata standards which, for spatial data, has resulted in the recent ratification of ISO19115. Many organisations in the geoscience community are working to implement this and related standards, but often as separate and uncoordinated activities.\nAlthough the CGI does not have any formal working group concerned with geoscience metadata it was felt that it could help geoscience organisations develop their metadata implementations by providing a forum for posting work and discussions. Hopefully this will enable organisations to learn from one another and thus save development time.\nThe ISO19115 standard recognises that different organisations or user communities may wish to specify their own implementations of the standard, for example by making specific restrictions on the values that can be entered to particular fields or adding extensions to meet their specific needs. These can be defined, and registered, as ISO community profiles. There may be advantages in developing such a profile for the geoscience community, and if so this forum could be the first step in this direction. If there is sufficient interest from the community in developing a geoscience profile then a formal CGI working group might be needed.\nMetadata Posted Document List The following documents concerned with geoscience metadata have been submitted.

In this edition we particularly highlight the achievements of CGI members honoured with international awards in 2014.\nTable of Contents  CGI Members Honoured New Working Group Chair New Geoscience Vocabularies Upcoming Events News from South America  CGI and OneGeology CGI in Argentina   CGI 2014 Annual Report GIRAF at CAG 25 in Dar es Salaam Meet Your CGI Councillors Featured Project Join Us on LinkedIn   CGI Members Honoured Three members of CGI have recently been honoured with awards from international information management and data standards organisations.\nDr Xiaogang (Marshall) Ma was awarded the World Data System (WDS-ICSU) Data Stewardship Award for 2014 at the SciDataCon 2014 Conference in New Delhi. The award highlights exceptional contributions to the improvement of scientific data stewardship by early career researchers through their engagement with the community, academic achievements, and innovations.\nMarshall is a geoinformatics and data science researcher with extensive research in geoscience ontologies, and has worked recently on the capture and representation of data provenance in scientific workflows. Marshall is a member of the CGI Geoscience Terminology Working Group, the International Association for Mathematical Geosciences (IAMG; founder and first president of IAMG\u0026rsquo;s student chapter in 2010), the American Geophysical Union, and the Federation of Earth Science Information Partners. Marshall was coordinator for the GeoData 2014 workshop (highlighting inter-agency data networks in the US), and the 2014 Deep Carbon Observatory Data Science Day symposium, and organizer of a data provenance session for the Association of American Geographers 2014 Annual Meeting. See slides of Marshall\u0026rsquo;s award lecture \u0026ldquo;Why Data Science Matters\u0026rdquo;.\nDr Peter Baumann, Professor of Computer Science at Jacobs University and a current CGI council member, was awarded the Kenneth D. Gardels Award by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) for 2014. The award is in recognition of his \u0026ldquo;significant contribution to the OGC\u0026rsquo;s essential role and mission in the global Information Technology community\u0026rdquo;.\nJeffrey K. Harris, Chairman of the OGC Board of Directors, said: \u0026ldquo;We wish to express our deep appreciation for the extraordinary contribution you have made to the OGC community and to people around the world who are the ultimate beneficiaries of improvements in the development, management and use of geoscientific data. Devoting your time and bringing your dedication, expertise, critical thinking and leadership to OGC working groups has resulted in significant and enduring advances in technical standards. The value you\u0026rsquo;ve createdhas been leveraged, and the OGC\u0026rsquo;s work overall has been leveraged, through your active participation in other standards bodies, expert groups, councils and commissions. We thank you for this collaborative work, for it benefits us all.\u0026rdquo;\nPeter is editor of twelve adopted standards related to the OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) suite of Big Geo Data standards. Recently he has been instrumental in establishing a new Big Data Domain Working Group within the OGC which he also co-chairs. Peter\u0026rsquo;s research focuses on large-scale scientific information services, in particular: massive multi-dimensional data cubes. He has architected the rasdaman (\u0026ldquo;raster data manager\u0026rdquo;) technology which has pioneered a new research field, Array Databases.\nThe Geological Society of America honoured Ian Jackson with their Outstanding Contributions in Geoinformatics award for 2014. The award recognises an individual who has contributed in an outstanding manner to geology through the application of the principles of geoinformatics.\nIan was a councillor of CGI from 2004 to 2012. Ian understood the importance of standards to achieve the opening of geoscientific data for diverse uses, and took a decisive part in the recreation of the IUGS-CGI.\nThe award citation notes Ian\u0026rsquo;s long and superb service to advance the field of geoinformatics through his pioneering work at the British Geological Survey, to the establishment and unprecedented success of the OneGeology initiative. A dominant theme throughout Ian\u0026rsquo;s career has been the wide application of geoscience data for societal benefit, a goal he continues to promote as a consultant on the international stage. Ian has been one of the first in geological survey organizations worldwide to understand, and more importantly, to change the organization of the survey to fulfill its role of \u0026ldquo;information agency.\u0026rdquo;\nAmong his many accomplishments, Ian is perhaps best known as the primary instigator of OneGeology - a global initiative to make digital geological map data accessible throughout the world. Ian\u0026rsquo;s colleagues uniformly refer to his ability to inspire others on the OneGeology concept and build a strong team with the skills to create OneGeology, his keen awareness of how to get things done, and his ability to find constructive ways around obstacles as key to the success of the initiative.\nNew Working Group Chair Mark Rattenbury from GNS-New Zealand is the new chair of the CGI Geoscience Terminology Working Group. Mark took over from Steve Richard who handed over the reins after many years of inspirational leadership of CGI\u0026rsquo;s vocabulary development team. Mark has extensive experience in geological mapping, particularly of complexly deformed and metamorphosed basement terranes of Australia, Antarctica, and New Zealand. He led the 1:250 000 scale Geological Map of New Zealand programme to its conclusion in 2010 and is a specialist in geological map data management and dissemination using GIS software and web services. Mark is also a participant in the OGC/CGI GeoSciML Standards Working Group, as well as being the New Zealand representative on the OneGeology Technical Implementation Group.\nNew Geoscience Vocabularies The CGI Geoscience Terminology Working Group (GTWG) recently published 18 new geoscience vocabularies at the CGI\u0026rsquo;s vocabulary resources website. The vocabularies describe features of mineral resources such as resource shape and form, exploration and mining activities, and resource and reserve classifications. The GTWG worked in collaboration with the EarthResourceML Working Group to compile the new vocabularies to support the EarthResourceML data transfer standard, most importantly as the standard for mineral resource data transfer for the EU INSPIRE initiative.\nUpcoming Events  35th International Geological Congress, Cape Town\nPreliminary planning has begun within CGI Council for the Geoinformatics Symposium at the 2016 International Geological Congress in Cape Town, South Africa. If you would like to volunteer to help organise the symposium, please contact Kristine Asch.\nNews from South America CGI and OneGeology  \nSeveral CGI members presented at the South American OneGeology workshop in October in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Tim Duffy and Steve Richard outlined how CGI standards such as GeoSciML-Portrayal and CGI\u0026rsquo;s geoscience vocabularies can be used to publish digital map data through the OneGeology Portal. The value of OneGeology as a vehicle to promote data sharing and data standards was emphasised, and Santiago Muñoz Tapia, president of the Ibero-American Geological and Mining Surveys Association (ASGMI), offered to host a future OneGeology/GeoSciML-Portrayal training course in the Dominican Republic.\nCGI in Argentina   Left to right: CGI councillor Gabriel Asato, Dr Ruben Matheos (UnderSecretariat), Dr Cecatto (Secretariat Joint Science Technological, Ministry of Science, Technology and Production Innovation).\nArgentina recently enacted ministerial decisions concerning the development of national science digital repositories. An interview was conducted during 2014 with the Joint Science and Technology Secretariat. Then a meeting with the Secretariat, Dr Alejandro Ceccatto was arranged where the aims and activities of CGI-IUGS were presented to him by CGI councillor Gabriel Asato. Dr Ceccatto was very pleased to know about CGI-IUGS activities and expressed that it could be important to have a geoscience digital information chapter in the national science repositories project.\nCGI 2014 Annual Report The 2014 annual report of CGI to the IUGS is now available from the CGI website. The report describes the broad range of activities undertaken by CGI technical working groups and regional groups in 2014.\nGIRAF at CAG 25 in Dar es Salaam Since its foundation in 2009, the GIRAF network has been present at each Colloquium of African Geology (CAG) with a workshop or a session. A GIRAF workshop was held during 2014 \u0026ldquo;CAG 25\u0026rdquo; and the 3rd YES Network Congress in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The workshop was opened by the IUGS president Professor Roland Oberhänsli and supported by GSAf president Aberra Mogessie. The workshop was convened by Kristine Asch (CGI, BGR), Mesfin Gebremichael (SEAMIC), Terence Ngole (Geological Survey of Tansania) and Salvatore Mondlane Junior (Eduardo Mondlane University, Maputo). It encompassed seven presentations and additional contributions on geoscience information projects and initiatives in Africa, the African Mining Vision, and the role of GIRAF at universities, followed by discussions and the start of preparation for the next GIRAF workshop in Maputo, Mozambique in 2015. The event was concluded successfully and attended by 49 participants, mostly from Africa, and 20 new members joined GIRAF network. The GIRAF network was kindly mentioned at the final CAG 25 assembly by one of the main organizers, Nelson Boniface, in his concluding remarks as a positive and driving factor for geoscience information issues in Africa.\nMeet Your CGI Councillors Ollie Raymond has been involved in compiling and managing digital geological maps and databases at Geoscience Australia for over 20 years.

In this edition we welcome three new CGI councillors, and we kick off efforts to coordinate standards for 3D geological models.\nTable of Contents  New Members of CGI Council CGI Working Group News 3D Geological Data Models — a call for participants in a review of 3D standards GeoSciML News News from China News from Africa Featured Project Upcoming Events More Upcoming Events\u0026hellip; Meet Your CGI Councillors Join Us on LinkedIn   New Members of CGI Council Three new members have been elected to CGI Council to replace the recently retired Richard Hughes and to fill two other vacancies. We welcome Kombada Mhopjeni (Geological Survey of Namibia), Zhang Minghua (China Geological Survey), and Santiago Munoz (Geological Survey of the Dominican Republic).\nCGI Working Group News  \nThe Geoscience Terminology Working Group, in collaboration with the EarthResourceML Working Group recently approved the adoption of 18 new vocabularies to support delivery of mineral occurrence and mine data using the EarthResourceML data transfer standard. The vocabularies have been developed in collaboration with the European Union’s Minerals Intelligence Network for Europe (Minerals4EU), so that Minerals4EU vocabularies use either exactly the same terms or have mappings to CGI terminology. The vocabularies are to be published soon through the CGI\u0026rsquo;s vocabulary service.\n3D Geological Data Models — a call for participants in a review of 3D standards  \nBy nature, geological information is 3D (or even 4D). To date, CGI efforts to support geological data interoperability have focused on exchange of geological map and borehole information with GeoSciML and EarthResourceML, using GML as the underlying spatial data engine. With the growing demand for exchanging 3D geological models in many domains (eg, oil and gas, mining, groundwater, design of infrastructure), there is a clear need for standardizing the exchange of 3D models independently of the data format used by the modeling software.\nThere is currently no accepted generic exchange model for 3D geological models, although there have been some attempts in different organizations or projects. The CGI Council considers it a priority for the Commission to\n review the current situation in the delivery of 3D geological models, and propose a strategy for identifying or developing an agreed standard possibly in partnership with other standardization bodies.  We are now calling for volunteers to participate in an ad-hoc group to be setup in CGI on this topic. If you are interested, please email the CGI Chair, Francois Robida.\nGeoSciML News  \nThe joint OGC/CGI GeoSciML Standards Working Group (SWG) has recently held two teleconference meetings – one of them as part of the quarterly OGC Technical Committee meeting in Washington DC. Steve Richard provided a summary of his recent work to document the use cases needed for development of the GeoSciML version 4 standard. The working group will gather together in Tucson, USA from June 29 to July 3 for its annual face-to-face meeting. This will be held in conjunction with similar meetings of the EarthResourceML and Geoscience Terminology working groups, and the OneGeology Technical working group.\n A new user guide for GeoSciML data providers has also just been published by the British Geological Survey as part of their contribution to the EU INSPIRE initiative. The new user guide and other GeoSciML resources can be found on the GeoSciML website.\nNews from China A 1:1 million scale geological map of China has recently been released by the China Geological Survey as a contribution of China to the OneGeology initiative. The 1:1M geological map data cover most of the land areas of China and is now available as a OGC Web Map Service (WMS). Map layers include bedrock lithology, lithostratigraphy and major faults. For further information, contact your CGI councillor from China, Zhang Minghua.\nNews from Africa The 25th Colloquium of African Geology will be held in conjunction with the 3rd Congress of the Young Earth Scientists network (YES) in August 2014, in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. During the conference, the GIRAF Network and the Southern and Eastern African Mineral Centre (SEAMIC), is organising a session on geoscience information in Africa. Other conference participants are expected to include the Geological Society of Africa (GSAf), The African Association of Women Geologists (AAWG), OneGeology, AEGOS, and UNECA.\nThe geoscience information session will include presentations and discussions on the building of spatial data infrastructure in Africa, regional geoinformation initiatives; interoperability and standards; and best practices in delivery, dissemination and exploitation of geoscience information. Participants are encouraged to submit abstracts on their solutions and experiences of managing and delivering geoscience information to underpin public policy-making, investment, research and education. Contact the CGI secretary general and GIRAF coordinator Kristine Asch.\nFeatured Project  \n \nThe Canadian Groundwater Information Network (GIN) connects water well databases from British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatche-wan, Manitoba, Ontario, Québec, Nova-Scotia, and Yukon, and some key aquifer information from Natural Resources Canada.\nThe GIN data analysis portal enables users to view water wells and supporting hydrogeological maps in 2D and 3D, and to display and download geological well logs and water information from wells. The GIN makes use of the GroundwaterML data transfer standard for water wells and GeoSciML to deliver the downhole geological information.\nUpcoming Events  \nThe FOSS4G PDX 2014 conference will be held in Portland, Oregon, USA from 8–13 September. The annual FOSS4G conference is the largest global gathering focused on open source geospatial software. FOSS4G brings together developers, users, decision-makers and observers from a broad spectrum of organizations and fields of operation. Through six days of workshops, presentations, discussions, and cooperation, FOSS4G participants create effective and relevant geospatial products, standards, and protocols.\nCGI hopes to sponsor a competition at this conference for developers to design and build an application that displays innovative use of interoperable geoscience data, such as web map and web feature services and standard geoscience vocabularies.\nMore Upcoming Events\u0026hellip; CGI members Robert Tomas, Marco Komac and Carlo Cippoloni will be presenting at the 8th INSPIRE Conference in Aalborg Denmark, 16–20 June 2014. They will talk on aspects of European and global geoscience interoperability. The European Union’s INSPIRE interoperability initiative has been both a great user of, and valued contributor to the development of, the CGI’s geological data standards - GeoSciML and EarthResourceML.\nThe AfricaGEO 2014 Conference \u0026amp; Exhibition will be held at Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC) from 1–3 July 2014.

Recognising that the CGI council member will be able only to provide continental scale regional representation, the CGI council recognises the potential need to institute working groups that will address the specialised technical or scientific needs of regions defined by culture, geography or politics and encourages the establishment of CGI Regional Working Groups (RWG).\nRGW Activities RWGs will be required to respect the aims and policies of the CGI as outlined in the CGI Statutes and organise their own activities. In the interests of maintaining a consistent approach across all CGI activities and regions, RGWs must seek CGI Council approval before endorsing as a CGI product or standard, any locally developed standard, tool, or system. Where appropriate, RWGs can play an important role representing and promoting CGI aims and policies at relevant regional conferences, workshops and meetings but must inform CGI council if doing so.\nFunding The CGI is unfortunately unable to provide funding support to RGWs but will work to facilitate their operations wherever possible.\nLiaison with CGI Council CGI council will identify a council member to act as a liaison with the chairman of the RGW. The designated CGI council member will represent the RWG at CGI council meeting and be responsible for keeping their RWG(s) informed of CGI developments. Where appropriate, RGW chairmen may be requested to attend all or part of CGI council meetings.\nApplication Individuals wishing to form a RGW should make a written proposal to the CGI Council including:-\n Identification of the region they propose to represent; Their specific regional issues; Their proposed activities; Identification of a chairman and list of interested individuals and their affiliations; Full contact information for the proposed chairman (phone, address, email, fax).  Where possible, RGWs are encouraged to include as members, individuals from different institutions such as universities, geological surveys and industry. The CGI Council will evaluate proposals to establish RWGs and respond to the designated chairman within three weeks.\n","date":1402570248,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1402570248,"objectID":"44b2781140cabf407e53a4511c609ed3","permalink":"https://cgi-iugs.github.io/project/regionalwg/","publishdate":"2014-06-12T11:50:48+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/regionalwg/","section":"project","summary":"The CGI council recognises the potential need to institute working groups that will address the specialised technical or scientific needs of regions defined by culture, geography or politics and encourages the establishment of CGI Regional Working Groups (RWG).","tags":["active"],"title":"Regional Working Groups","type":"project"},{"authors":["CGI-IUGS"],"categories":["newsletter"],"content":"» View this newsletter as a PDF\nWelcome to the new face of CGI.

The ultimate objective of the working group was to enable seamless integration over the internet of geological information hosted at different agencies in varied formats. The working group conducted several testbeds to test the viability of technologies and standards within the context of individual agency activities.\nThe specific objectives of the working group were:\n to develop a conceptual model of geoscientific information drawing on existing data models to implement an agreed subset of this model in an agreed schema language implement an XML/GML encoding of the model subset develop a testbed to illustrate the potential of the data model for interchange identify areas that require standardised classifications in order to enable interchange  The Interoperability Working Group comprised several task groups to address specific aspects of the work:\n GeoSciML Design task group designed the GeoSciML data model and XML schemas for transfer of geological data. The work of the GeoSciML task group is being carried forward by the CGI/OGC GeoSciML Standards Working Group. Use Cases and Requirements task group developed technical goals for GeoSciML by describing new use-cases and requirements; Service Architecture task group developed and documented the formal architecture required to deliver GeoSciML services Implementation Testbed task group coordinated interoperability testbeds using GeoSciML; Geoscience Concept Definitions task group was responsible for designing vocabulary services that satisfy the requirements of GeoSciML. The work of this task group has been merged with the Multilingual Thesaurus Working Group into the Geoscience Terminology Working Group. Outreach and Technical Assistance task group provided advice and assistance to direct collaborators, assisting them to deploy conformant GeoSciML Services. EarthResourceML task group developed the CGI data model for mineral occurrences and mines data, based on the Australia/NZ mineral deposits model.
