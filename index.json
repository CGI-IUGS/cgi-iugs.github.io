EarthResourceML (ERML) is an XML-based data transfer standard for the exchange of digital information for mineral occurrences, mines and mining activity. EarthResourceML describes the geological characteristics and setting of mineral occurrences, their contained commodities and their mineral resource and reserve endowment. It is also able to describe mines and mining activities, and production of concentrates, refined product and waste materials.\nEarthResourceML makes use of the existing GeoSciML data standard for describing geological materials associated with mineral deposits. It is also underpinned by established OGC and ISO standards, including web feature service (WFS - ISO 19142), geography markup language (GML - ISO 19136), and SWE Common.\nA parallel data standard for simple visualisation, EarthResourceML-Lite (ERML Lite), has also been developed. It enables the portrayal of a simplified set of the ERML data model using web map services (WMS) or simple web feature services (WFS).\nExample uses:\n \n \n \nHistory of EarthResourceML EarthResourceML (ERML) was born from a model developed by the Australian Government Geoscience Information Committee (GGIC) from 2004–2008. The CGI took over governance of the Australian model in 2008, and, after modifications by the CGI Interoperability Working Group, EarthResourceML version 1.1 was published in 2009. After some further revision, mainly to accommodate the needs of the European INSPIRE Directive, EarthResourceML version 2.0 was published in 2013.\nFuture development of ERML, and the simple-feature variant of ERML (ERML Lite), which supports simple portrayal requirements (e.g. WMS), will be undertaken by the EarthResourceML Working Group.\nERML Lite version 1.0 was published in 2016 and the current version (2.0) was accepted in 2017 and published in 2018.\nThe international ERML development team meets at least annually to ensure that ERML continues to address the needs of data providers and users.

Why do we need GeoSciML?  History of GeoSciML  Downloads and Other Resources  GeoSciML Standards Working Group  Global Use of GeoSciML   Join the GeoSciML team\nWhat is GeoSciML GeoSciML is an XML–based data transfer standard for the exchange of digital geoscientific information. It accommodates the representation and description of features typically found on geological maps, as well as being extensible to other geoscience data such as drilling, sampling, and analytical data.\nGeoSciML provides a standard data structure for a suite of common geologic features (eg, geologic units, structures, earth materials) and artefacts of geological investigations (eg, boreholes, specimens, measurements). Supporting objects such as the geologic timescale and vocabularies are also provided as linked resources, so that they can be used as classifiers for the primary objects in the GeoSciML standard.\nThe GeoSciML data standard is underpinned by several established OGC and ISO standards, including Web Feature Service (WFS – ISO 19142), Geography Markup Language (GML – ISO 19136), Observations \u0026amp; Measurements (O\u0026amp;M – ISO 19156), and SWE Common.\nA parallel data standard for simple map visualisation, GeoSciML-Portrayal, has also been developed. It enables portrayal of a small simplified subset of the GeoSciML data model using Web Map Services (WMS) or simple Web Feature Services (WFS).\nWhy do we need GeoSciML Users of geoscience maps and data know that geological features have no respect for national or provincial borders. Inevitably users of geoscience data will need to source data from more than one data provider. Receiving data in a number of local data formats is recognised as a major impediment to efficient and effective use of data.\nGeoSciML seeks to provide a single, open source, globally agreed data structure that is used to deliver digital geological data over the internet. Additionally, the use of agreed vocabularies of geoscience terminology provides consistency in the semantic language used across geological datasets. Data providers do not need to change their internal databases to match the GeoSciML structure, but instead translate their data to the GeoSciML structure at the point of delivery.\nHistory of GeoSciML The GeoSciML project was initiated in 2003 under the auspices of the CGI Working Group on Data Model Collaboration. The project was incorporated into the newly formed CGI Interoperability Working Group in 2004. In 2013, development of GeoSciML was moved to the current GeoSciML Standards Working Group, a collaboration between the CGI and the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).\nA number of predecessor projects from North America, Europe, Australia and Asia have had a strong influence on the development of GeoSciML. These include activities undertaken within national statutory bodies (eg, British and Japanese Geological Surveys), in multi-jurisdictional contexts (eg, the North American Data Model for geological maps) or oriented to an industry sector (eg, the Australian Exploration and Mining Markup Language - XMML).\nThe international GeoSciML development team meets at least annually to ensure that GeoSciML continues to address the needs of data providers and users. Most recent meetings have been held in St Petersburg (2013), Tuscon (2014), Ispra (2015), Dublin (2016) and Vienna (2017).\nDownloads and Other Resources   www.geosciml.org — Documentation, cookbooks, UML models, examples, and XML schemas for GeoSciML and GeoSciML-Portrayal.  schemas.geosciml.org — XML schemas for GeoSciML and GeoSciML-Portrayal.  resource.geosciml.org — Geoscience vocabularies to support the GeoSciML data model, developed by the CGI Geoscience Terminology Working group and its predecessors.

The GTWG manages these vocabularies and their associated documentation for use in geoscience information systems, in particular for the GeoSciML and EarthResourceML data transfer standards. The group assesses proposals for new geoscience vocabularies and change requests for existing CGI vocabularies. GTWG also liaises with other semantic interoperability groups to ensure cross-domain interoperability and promotes the use of vocabularies for enhanced dataset interoperability.\nOur vocabularies More than 100 geoscience vocabularies have been identified to support the GeoSciML and EarthResourceML data models and over 50 of these have now been compiled and adopted. These are available through the CGI vocabularies register. These vocabularies include key lists such as:\n lithology\n265 lithological rock names, hierarchically organised around up to six levels e.g. tholeiitic basalt, basalt, basic igneous rock, basic igneous material, igneous material, compound material\n resource commodity types\n293 types of earth-sourced commodity, hierarchically organised around up to six levels e.g. anthracite, coal, carbonaceous material, organic material, industrial material, direct use commodity\n nature of rock unit contacts\n36 types of geological contacts, hierarchically organised around up to five levels, e.g. angular unconformable contact, unconformable contact, depositional contact, lithogenetic contact, contact\n borehole drilling method\n30 types of drilling technology, hierarchically organised around up to three levels e.g. gravity core, direct push, core drilling\nThe important CGI geological time vocabulary service will be merged into the main CGI vocabularies register in the near future. The geological time vocabulary draws on age definitions established by the International Commission on Stratigraphy and was the first CGI vocabulary to provide multi-lingual terms, currently in 19 languages.\nThe CGI vocabulary service is hosted by the Australian National Data Service and is administered through Geoscience Australia. Additional resources are available from the Research Vocabularies Australia website, including downloadable code-lists in Resource Description Framework (RDF) formats (e.g. RDF/XML, JSON, Turtle) and Linked Data APIs.\nBackground The CGI has had two previous workgroups involved in vocabulary production. The Multi-lingual Thesaurus Working Group was formed in 2003 to continue work of the Multhes working group of the 1990s. The Concept Definition Task Group was formed by the CGI Interoperability Working Group in 2007 to develop concept vocabularies for populating GeoSciML interchange documents. Because of the overlapping interests the CGI council has determined that it will be more efficient and effective to merge the efforts. The Geoscience Terminology Working Group was established early in 2013 to undertake this combined role.\nWhy are vocabularies needed? Vocabularies are restricted lists of agreed terms that describe features contained in database fields. By limiting database values to the contents of common agreed vocabularies the interoperability and interchange of the information is enhanced. The list contents are also multi-lingual where translations of the originating list language are made available in other languages. Vocabularies also organise their terms hierarchically so that terms can be parts of a group that is a valid term itself. For example \u0026ldquo;basalt\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;gabbroic rock\u0026rdquo; are narrower adopted CGI terms for the broader level \u0026ldquo;basic igneous rock\u0026rdquo;. and this enables database searching or map portrayal based on either the broader or the narrower term.\nHow vocabularies are adopted Proposals for new geoscience vocabularies or change requests for existing CGI vocabularies, are lodged with the GTWG, usually instigated from within the group but can be initiated from outside for a specific requirement. Each proposal is assessed by the group to establish whether the changes are minor and do not require the GTWG\u0026rsquo;s formal consultation, review and adoption process or whether the proposed changes are significant and need input from the group. Each new or changed vocabulary proposal is assigned a \u0026lsquo;shepherd\u0026rsquo; responsible for developing a draft vocabulary if new, or modifying a version of an existing vocabulary. The vocabulary proposal is then reviewed by the GTWG and through them colleagues and the wider community. After consultation and response to comments, the shepherd recommends voting for its adoption to the GTWG. Upon adoption, the vocabulary is registered in the CGI vocabulary repository.\nInitial vocabulary development typically begins with a spreadsheet compilation of candidate terms using Excel and Google Sheets shared spreadsheets on the GTWG Google Drive facility. When a vocabulary has been completed, reviewed and adopted, it is migrated into SKOS, an RDF application for encoding concepts with identifiers, definitions, source information, standard thesaurus type relationships, and language-localized labels. The RDF-encoded file is then migrated on to the vocabulary server, for example the commodity code vocabulary.\nHow to lodge a Request for Change A Request for Change refers to a proposal to modify an adopted existing CGI vocabulary or to propose a new geoscience vocabulary. The GTWG recognise that the adopted vocabularies will not always suit all user requirements and that needs of the wider geoscience community will evolve. Adopted vocabularies should be regarded as live working versions rather than irrevocably finalised. The GTWG will consider a Request for Change from groups or individuals outside of the working group. These Requests for Change can be sent to the working group via an email request to chair.gtwg@gmail.com. Alternatively a Request for Change can be sent to a GTWG member directly.\nMembership The GTWG contains members from all over the world. The current membership of 27 includes representatives from geological surveys of Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, New Zealand, Russia, Slovenia, Sweden and USA.\nThe GTWG needs active participation in the construction of geoscience vocabularies. Participants with expertise in specialist geoscience domains, information science and data models are particularly welcomed. For those who would like to contribute to the GTWG should contact the Chair, outlining their areas of expertise and their capacity to assist.\n","date":1560336603,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560336603,"objectID":"655e26b95cb804a803c91fe81d502c82","permalink":"https://cgi-iugs.github.io/project/geoscienceterminology/","publishdate":"2019-06-12T11:50:03+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/geoscienceterminology/","section":"project","summary":"A CGI working group developing and publishing multi-lingual geoscience vocabularies","tags":["active"],"title":"Geoscience Terminology Working Group (GTWG)","type":"project"},{"authors":["CGI-IUGS"],"categories":["news"],"content":" EarthResourceML-Lite is a data model and schema for simple map services (e.g. WMS and WFS Simple Features).

Send applications to CGIsecretariat@mail.cgs.gov.cn  Review of Applicants by CGI Council The CGI Council will review the applications based on the criteria outlined above and select a maximum of 30 applicants to stand for election for the 12 possible Council positions. A principal objective of the selection process will be to identify a group of applicants with diverse and complementary expertise and regional affiliation. In the case of Council members standing for re-election, their contribution and meeting attendance during the current term will be amongst the factors considered.\nThe Election Process  CGI members will be emailed by the Secretary General voting instructions and a list of candidates and asked to vote for a maximum of 12 councillors. Four weeks will be allowed for voting. Approximately 2 months before the annual General Assembly at the International Geological Congress, the identity of all selected candidates will be put on the CGI Website accompanied by a brief description of their background and skills. New CGI members who join CGI after this date will not be permitted to participate in this election process. At the end of the voting period, the CGI Council will compile the votes and identify the successful candidates. To fill the geographical requirement and ensure that all regions of the world are represented, a minimum of 1, and a maximum of 4 candidates, will be selected from each of the 5 identified geographic regions of the globe. This will be achieved by choosing an initial candidate with the most votes for every one of the 5 regions, then the other candidates will be selected according to the number of votes they have obtained, with a limit of 4 per region. The successful candidates will be contacted by email to request that they confirm in writing that they will have support of their agencies to participate in CGI Council activities and attend annual CGI Council meetings. Upon receipt of confirmation of support, the new Council will be announced to CGI members and the IUGS Secretariat by email; and also posted on the CGI website approximately 2 months in advance of the IGC.

In this edition we report on the progress of the CGI Working Groups and the recent meetings of CGI members.\nTable of Contents  A Busy Time for CGI GeoSciML Standards Working Group Towards a New Version of ERML Geoscience Vocabularies News from Asia  CCOP Workshop on IGDP and Compilation Technology Information Sharing for the \u0026lsquo;Belt and Route Region\u0026rsquo;   News from South America  Ibero-American Open Science Meeting in Buenos Aires   CGI Standards in New Zealand CGI Council News 32nd Annual GIC Conference Upcoming Events  Resources for Future Generations — Vancouver, June 2018   Meet Your CGI Councillors Featured Project Join Us on LinkedIn   A Busy Time for CGI May and June was a busy time for many CGI members. Three of CGI\u0026rsquo;s standards working groups, the CGI Council, the OneGeology Technical Implementation Group, and the 32nd annual Geoscience Information Consortium (GIC) conference all met over a period of two weeks in Vienna, Austria and Orleans, France.\nGeoSciML Standards Working Group The OGC/CGI GeoSciML Standards Working Group (SWG) held its annual face-to-face meeting at Geologische Bundesanstalt (Geological Survey of Austria) in Vienna in May. This was the first meeting since the GeoSciML v4.1 data standard was ratified and published by OGC in March. All current documentation and schemas are now hosted on the OGC website. The original CGI website still maintains access to all historic versions of GeoSciML and links to other supporting resources like UML models and vocabularies.\nAfter 8 years as Chair of the Working Group, Ollie Raymond stepped down and Eric Boisvert (pictured) from the Geological Survey of Canada has taken on the role. We wish Eric and the team every success as the SWG enters a new phase in GeoSciML development. The working group discussed minor corrections to the version 4.1 standard, considered a GML version 3.2 profile of GeoSciML-Lite, and reviewed the best practice of delivering data using the GeoSciML-Lite data standard.\nMembers also considered the future direction of the SWG, in particular towards potential new standard encodings of the GeoSciML data model, such as RDF and JSON.\nTowards a New Version of ERML The annual EarthResourceML (ERML) Working Group meeting was held in June in Orleans, France, hosted by BRGM. CGI members from France, Finland, Australia and New Zealand attended the one day meeting.\nThe working group discussed a proposal from Geoscience Australia for a modification to way that the ERML-Lite data standard delivers commodity resource and reserve amounts. This request was based on the Australian and New Zealand experience of recently establishing the world\u0026rsquo;s first ERML-Lite WFS services.\nThe EU-funded ProSum project also presented a proposal to extend the ERML full model. The proposal will add Processing Activity and Processing Plant to the model. Other technical changes, including links to GeoSciML v4 and implementing recent GeoSciML modelling patterns, will be added to the EarthResourceML and after a review and voting period, a new version ERML v 3.0 will be published later in 2017.\nCGI intends to have a strong presence at the RFG2018 conference in Vancouver in June 2018, in particular to promote ERML and ERML-Lite to North America. New ERML and ERML-Lite implementations and use cases will be demonstrated there. Documentation and schemas for EarthResourceML v2.0 and EarthResourceML-Lite v1.0 are available on the www.earthresourceml.org website.\nGeoscience Vocabularies The CGI Geoscience Terminology Working Group (GTWG) met for its fourth face-to-face meeting at the Geological Survey of Austria in Vienna on May 26. Twenty-two people participated in person or remotely. Several key vocabularies that are in advanced stages of preparation have been prioritised for completion, notably the Natural Geomorphologic Feature, Mineral Deposit Type and Regional Lithological Unit Synthesis vocabularies.\nA presentation by Chris Schubert from the Austrian Climate Change Centre outlined development on federated registries of vocabularies in Europe, and has helped confirm that GTWG’s role in providing globally-relevant geoscience terms that can work in parallel with geological surveys’ more local vocabulary requirements.\n \nThe CGI Vocabulary Service, hosted by Australia’s CSIRO for around a decade, is in the process of being moved to its new hosting organisation, Geoscience Australia. As part of the move to new hosting arrangements, all 2016 editions of CGI\u0026rsquo;s vocabularies are also incorporated in the Research Vocabularies Australia vocabulary service, a broader science vocabularies service that is available online globally.\nNews from Asia CCOP Workshop on IGDP and Compilation Technology A cooperation project between China and the Southeast Asia Geoscience Program Coordinating Committee (CCOP) on Integrated Geological Data Processing (IGDP) was kicked off at a workshop hosted by the China Geological Survey (CGS) on 22–24 May in Beijing.\nThe workshop included training for CCOP member countries on data processing techniques for geological, geophysical and geochemical data. Twenty participants from Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam and the CCOP Technical Secretariat joined a discussion on OneGeology geological map data delivery technologies, and regional geoscience map compilation techniques. A work plan for the next two years was prepared.\nInformation Sharing for the \u0026lsquo;Belt and Route Region\u0026rsquo; A seminar was held at the China Geological Survey in Beijing on 16–20 May, 2017, aimed at geoscience information sharing amongst the vast region of the so-called the \u0026lsquo;Belt and Route Region\u0026rsquo;. The region, coined by the Chinese government, covers part or all of Oceania, Asia, Europe, Arab and Africa. More than 50 officials and experts from different geological organisations exchanged views and shared current technology for data exchange and information sharing. CGI-IUGS standards and the CCOP metadata standard will be used for data transfer once the cooperation project application is approved by the Chinese government.\nNews from South America Ibero-American Open Science Meeting in Buenos Aires An international Seminar on Open Science was held in Buenos Aires, Argentina from May 31 to June 2. The seminar was organised under the auspices of the Ibero-American States Organizations, Portugal, Uruguay, and the Argentina Ministry of Science and Technology. Science, technology and innovation agencies from Spain, Brasil and Colombia also participated.\nThe seminar discussed \u0026lsquo;Open Science\u0026rsquo; to enable collaborative research and knowledge distribution by digital means. In particular, the regional science community see it as a way to improve science and technology development and performance in South America.\nThe meeting was focused mainly on open digital repositories. In this context, not only will written publications be reviewed, but also their supporting data and results. It is hoped that in the future this initial step by Latin American countries will facilitate the access to and development of interoperable data and methods for any kind of scientific data. The regional science community intends to facilitiate the development of initiatives currently occurring at different levels and domains in international organisations like IUGS CGI, ICSU, and the Research Data Alliance.\nCGI Standards in New Zealand GNS Science, the New Zealand government geoscience agency, is just one example of a data provider embracing CGI data standards.\nAs mentioned in the EarthResourceML news above, an EarthResourceML-Lite-compliant web service of New Zealand\u0026rsquo;s mineral occurrences is available (see gns:GERM_ERML_VIEW). Two New Zealand geological map datasets — the 1:1M Geological map of New Zealand and the 1:250k Geological Map of Southern Victoria Land (Antarctica) — are now available as GeoSciML Lite-compliant web services, have been accredited with 4-star OneGeology status, and can be accessed from the GNS web service interface. The layers include links to CGI codelists for age terms, unit types, representative lithology and metadata records.\nThe 2017 version of the QMAP 1:250 000 Geological Map of New Zealand seamless GIS dataset contains links to CGI code-lists for age terms, unit types, representative lithology and metadata records amongst others. New Zealand’s Petlab Geoanalytical Database of rock and mineral properties has also incorporated CGI vocabulary terms for rock names and geological age.\nCGI Council News The CGI Council held its 2017 annual meeting in Vienna in June.\nThe councillors addressed:\n activities for CGI funding in 2017–18 planning for the RFG 2018 conference in Vancouver next year a proposal for the coordination of hydrogeology data standards development in CGI and OGC the need to recruit and rejuvenate active membership in CGI working groups better promotion of CGI activities and standards  32nd Annual GIC Conference The Geoscience Information Consortium (GIC) is an annual gathering of information managers from international government Geological Survey agencies. The 32nd GIC Conference was held from May 29 to June 3 at the Geological Survey of Austria (GBA) in Vienna. Many CGI members attended, and shared their work with Geological Survey representatives from 35 countries from every continent.\nThe conference heard a wide range of presentations on current best practice in data management and data delivery from many individual Geological Surveys, as well as collaborative data sharing initiatives from around the world. Panel discussion sessions also shared the experiences and requirements of the Geological Surveys in managing and delivering 3D geological models, future data management strategies, and emerging technologies.\nGovernment Geological Survey information managers are encouraged to join the 33rd annual GIC conference which will be hosted by Geoscience Australia in Canberra, Australia in mid 2018.\nUpcoming Events Resources for Future Generations — Vancouver, June 2018 CGI cordially invites its members to the RFG 2018 conference in Vancouver, Canada, 16–21 June 2018. IUGS is a partner organisation at this conference and CGI encourages all its members to at the conference to demonstrate how CGI\u0026rsquo;s standards and best practice in data delivery and analysis supports and enables sustainable resource discovery and exploitation. It is anticipated that the use of web service data delivery, in particular using the EarthResourceML and EarthResourceML-Lite data transfer standards, will be a feature. The conference will be a forum for industry stakeholders to discuss their research initiatives and activities as well as the key issues and trends shaping the future of energy, minerals and water resources.\nMeet Your CGI Councillors Dr Zhang Minghua is co-Secretary General of CGI and Director of Geoinformation and Engineering at the Development Research Center of the China Geological Survey.

In this edition we provide a look back at 2016 and a taste of what is to come in 2017.\nTable of Contents  GeoSciML - OGC Accreditation EarthResourceML-Lite 2016 IUGS Science Excellence Award Geoscience Vocabularies A Successful 35th IGC News from Africa News from China CGI Council News Upcoming Events  Geoscience Information Consortium — Vienna, May 2017 Resources for Future Generations — Vancouver, June 2018   Meet Your CGI Councillors Featured Project Join Us on LinkedIn   GeoSciML - OGC Accreditation  \nThe GeoSciML data transfer standard was recently accepted by a unanimous vote of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Technical Committee. This significant milestone cements GeoSciML\u0026rsquo;s place as the international geological data transfer standard.\nDocumentation and schemas for GeoSciML version 4.1 will be available on the OGC and www.geosciml.org websites early in 2017. Due to some changes required by the OGC review process, GeoSciML will move from version 4.0 to version 4.1. The most significant change in version 4.1 is the renaming of GeoSciML-Portrayal to GeoSciML-Lite to avoid confusion with use of the word \u0026lsquo;portrayal\u0026rsquo; in other standards domains. The only other changes from version 4.0 to 4.1 are minor bug fixes and improvements to documentation.\nThe considerable documentation required for OGC accreditation was compiled by Eric Boisvert of the Geological Survey of Canada, with assistance from Ollie Raymond (Geoscience Australia) and Marcus Sen (British Geological Survey). Many thanks for a great effort!\nEarthResourceML-Lite A new abridged, simple feature (WFS SF-0) version of the EarthResourceML data model was released by CGI in August 2016. EarthResourceML-Lite (or ERML-Lite) can be used to deliver simplified views on mineral occurrences and their commodities, mines, mining activities and mine waste products.\nERML-Lite has a similar purpose to GeoSciML-Lite, in that it enables delivery of a simplified view of the full EarthResourceML model which can be used for exchange of data in simple formats that can be easily rendered in GIS applications and web mapping portals (e.g., WMS, simple WFS, shapefiles, CSV tables).\n2016 IUGS Science Excellence Award Dr Stephen Richard, recently of the Arizona Geological Survey and now at Columbia University, USA, was awarded the 2016 IUGS Science Excellence Award in Geoscience Information at the 35th Intern-ational Geological Congress.\nSteve was a research geologist and Head of Geoinformatics at the Arizona Geological Survey from 1992 until 2016, but his influence on North American and international geoinformatics extends way beyond the borders of Arizona. Steve was a leading member of the North American Geological Map Data Model (NADM) Steering Committee from 2000 to 2007. He worked with this consortium of American and Canadian geoscientists, database designers, and developers of geologic map information to develop a comprehensive geological data model that would form one of the foundations for global standards development.\nSteve was a founding member of the CGI Interoperability Working Group in 2004. As part of this group, Steve was a leading force for over 10 years in the development of the GeoSciML standard for geoscience data transfer.\nSteve has also been deeply involved in development of international geoscience vocabularies through the IUGS CGI Controlled Vocabularies Working Group, and was the founding Chair of the CGI Geoscience Terminology Working Group. Over 30 internationally-agreed vocabularies were published under Steve\u0026rsquo;s leadership.\nSteve has also been a leader in technical development of the US Geoscience Information Network (USGIN) - especially as chief architect of the US National Geothermal Data System - to deploy web services for geoscience information exchange. His advocacy of OGC and CGI standards in US geological surveys has led to these global standards being embedded in North American data delivery best practice.\nGeoscience Vocabularies The Geoscience Terminology Working Group (GTWG) has been working away compiling key vocabularies to support the GeoSciML and EarthResourceML geoscience data models. The CGI vocabulary service has been hosted by CSIRO in Australia from its inception, but is soon to be migrated onto a server hosted by Geoscience Australia. The GTWG is very appreciative of the efforts of CSIRO in developing and maintaining the vocabulary service for over a decade and thanks Geoscience Australia for agreeing to support the service into the future.\nThe important Commodity Code vocabulary was compiled and adopted in 2015; a highly hierarchically organised vocabulary of 291 terms describing natural and processed earth resource commodities. This vocabulary is showcased in the Minerals4EU Map Viewer web application for mineral commodities around Europe.\nThe EarthResourceML vocabularies have been translated into 22 other European languages through the INSPIRE directive and these multi-lingual vocabularies will be adapted for delivery through the CGI vocabulary service. Many more vocabularies are still required, particularly for the Extension schema of the GeoSciML model.\nThe Working Group is always looking for more active members to contribute to compilation of geoscience vocabularies, particularly in languages other than English. Contact the group\u0026rsquo;s chair, compose(\u0026lsquo;M.Rattenbury\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;gns\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cri.nz\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Mark Rattenbury\u0026rsquo;);, if you would like to contribute to the work.\nA Successful 35th IGC A successful \u0026ldquo;Geoscience Data \u0026amp; Information Systems\u0026rdquo; symposium was held at the 35th International Geological Congress in Cape Town in August. Over 40 presentations were given on a wide range of digital geological data management, data analysis, and data delivery topics.\nMore than 20 people attended the CGI workshop on geoscience web services. Presentations were given by the leaders of all the CGI working groups, and experts from the OneGeology and INSPIRE projects.\nNews from Africa The GIRAF Network was transferred fully into African hands at the 26th Colloquium of African Geology (CAG26) in Ibadan in November. The network coordinator since 2009, Dr Kristine Asch (BGR and CGI) ceremonially handed over the reins to Ibrahim Shaddad, Director of the African Mineral and Geosciences Centre in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, where the new GIRAF office will be located.\n \u0026ldquo;Knowledge-based geoscience information is more important than ever, especially in Africa\u0026rdquo;\n said Kristine.\nGIRAF was founded in 2009 as a platform for African geoscience information experts to share information and experience to understand the needs and issues in geoscience information management, delivery and technology in Africa. Its aim is to improve the environmental conditions and economic circumstances of Africa though the application of information technology based on geoscience data and information.\nSince its inauguration, the network has been primarily supported by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), BGR, UNESCO Nairobi, the Geological Society of Africa, AusAid (Australia), the United Nations Development Programme, the IUGS Commission for Geoscience Information (CGI) and many more organizations. GIRAF has more than 400 members from more than 30 African and 12 non-African countries.\nNews from China GeoSciML Standards Work-ing Group chair Ollie Raymond, and recent CGI Councillor Dr Kristine Asch visited the China Geological Survey (CGS) in Beijing in November to present a series of talks on geoscience information standards. Ollie and Kristine were hosted by Dr Zhang Minghua, Director of Geoinformation and Engineering at the CGS Development Research Center.\nThe presentations were attended by 30 staff from the Beijing and provincial offices of the CGS.\nCGI Council News A new CGI Council for 2016–2020 was sworn in at the 35th International Geological Congress in Cape Town in September 2016. Founding CGI member and CGI Secretary-General, Kristine Asch, left the Council to take up a role as a Vice-President of IUGS. Thank you Kristine for your many years of commitment to CGI.\nKombada Mhopjeni (Namibia) and Zhang Minghua (China) were elected as joint Secretary-General, and Francois Robida (France) remains as CGI Council Chair. The Council also welcomed two new members, Tomasz Nałęcz (Poland) and Harvey Thorleifson (USA).\nThe CGI 2012–2016 four-year report was also submitted to the IUGS council at the 35th IGC in Cape Town. Read about all CGI\u0026rsquo;s activities and achievements over the past four years.\nUpcoming Events Geoscience Information Consortium — Vienna, May 2017 CGI will hold its annual Standards Working Groups and Council meetings in conjunction with the 32nd annual Geoscience Information Consortium (GIC) conference in Vienna, Austria, 29 May – 2 June, 2017.\nGIC is an international forum to exchange information among Geological Surveys Organisations (GSOs) related to the use and management of geoscience information systems in support of the earth sciences.\nResources for Future Generations — Vancouver, June 2018 CGI has begun planning to have a substantial presence at the RFG 2018 conference in Vancouver, Canada, 16–21 June 2018. IUGS is a partner organisation at this conference.

It is the CGI Council\u0026rsquo;s pleasure to nominate him for the outstanding scientist award.\nSteve was a research geologist and Head of Geoinformatics at the Arizona Geological Survey from 1992 until 2016, but his influence on North American and international geoinformatics extends way beyond the borders of Arizona.\nSteve was a leading member of the North American Geological Map Data Model (NADM) Steering Committee from 2000 to 2007. He worked with this consortium of American and Canadian geoscientists, database designers, and developers of geologic map information to develop a comprehensive geological data model that would form one of the foundations for global standards development through the IUGS Commission for the Management and Application of Geoscience Information (CGI).\nSteve was a founding member of the IUGS CGI Interoperability Working Group in 2004. As part of this group, Steve was a leading force for over 10 years in the development of the GeoSciML standard for geoscience data transfer. In 2016, GeoSciML is now recognised as the data transfer standard for geoscience data sharing projects around the world, including OneGeology, INSPIRE, USGIN, AuScope and others.\nSteve has also been deeply involved in development of international geoscience vocabularies through the IUGS CGI Controlled Vocabularies Working Group, and was the founding Chair of the successor CGI Geoscience Terminology Working Group. Over 30 internationally-agreed vocabularies were published under Steve\u0026rsquo;s leadership.\nSteve has been a leader in technical development of the US Geoscience Information Network (USGIN) - especially as chief architect of the US National Geothermal Data System - to deploy web services for geoscience information exchange. His advocacy of OGC and CGI standards in US geological surveys has led to these global standards being embedded in North American data delivery best practice.\nSteve has also recently worked with the International Organization for Standardization as the editor of the ISO19115-3 geospatial metadata standard, and is an active participant in the Earth Cube geoscience community in the USA.\n\u0026ldquo;I am deeply honoured to have received the Science Excellence Award 2016 In Geoscience Information.

As a result of this there has been a considerable amount of effort put into developing metadata standards which, for spatial data, has resulted in the recent ratification of ISO19115. Many organisations in the geoscience community are working to implement this and related standards, but often as separate and uncoordinated activities.\nAlthough the CGI does not have any formal working group concerned with geoscience metadata it was felt that it could help geoscience organisations develop their metadata implementations by providing a forum for posting work and discussions. Hopefully this will enable organisations to learn from one another and thus save development time.\nThe ISO19115 standard recognises that different organisations or user communities may wish to specify their own implementations of the standard, for example by making specific restrictions on the values that can be entered to particular fields or adding extensions to meet their specific needs. These can be defined, and registered, as ISO community profiles. There may be advantages in developing such a profile for the geoscience community, and if so this forum could be the first step in this direction. If there is sufficient interest from the community in developing a geoscience profile then a formal CGI working group might be needed.\nMetadata Posted Document List The following documents concerned with geoscience metadata have been submitted.

The award highlights exceptional contributions to the improvement of scientific data stewardship by early career researchers through their engagement with the community, academic achievements, and innovations.\nMarshall is a geoinformatics and data science researcher with extensive research in geoscience ontologies, and has worked recently on the capture and representation of data provenance in scientific workflows. Marshall is a member of the CGI Geoscience Terminology Working Group, the International Association for Mathematical Geosciences (IAMG; founder and first president of IAMG\u0026rsquo;s student chapter in 2010), the American Geophysical Union, and the Federation of Earth Science Information Partners. Marshall was coordinator for the GeoData 2014 workshop (highlighting inter-agency data networks in the US), and the 2014 Deep Carbon Observatory Data Science Day symposium, and organizer of a data provenance session for the Association of American Geographers 2014 Annual Meeting. See slides of Marshall\u0026rsquo;s award lecture \u0026ldquo;Why Data Science Matters\u0026rdquo;.\nDr Peter Baumann, Professor of Computer Science at Jacobs University and a current CGI council member, was awarded the Kenneth D. Gardels Award by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) for 2014. The award is in recognition of his \u0026ldquo;significant contribution to the OGC\u0026rsquo;s essential role and mission in the global Information Technology community\u0026rdquo;.\nJeffrey K. Harris, Chairman of the OGC Board of Directors, said: \u0026ldquo;We wish to express our deep appreciation for the extraordinary contribution you have made to the OGC community and to people around the world who are the ultimate beneficiaries of improvements in the development, management and use of geoscientific data. Devoting your time and bringing your dedication, expertise, critical thinking and leadership to OGC working groups has resulted in significant and enduring advances in technical standards. The value you\u0026rsquo;ve createdhas been leveraged, and the OGC\u0026rsquo;s work overall has been leveraged, through your active participation in other standards bodies, expert groups, councils and commissions. We thank you for this collaborative work, for it benefits us all.\u0026rdquo;\nPeter is editor of twelve adopted standards related to the OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) suite of Big Geo Data standards. Recently he has been instrumental in establishing a new Big Data Domain Working Group within the OGC which he also co-chairs. Peter\u0026rsquo;s research focuses on large-scale scientific information services, in particular: massive multi-dimensional data cubes. He has architected the rasdaman (\u0026ldquo;raster data manager\u0026rdquo;) technology which has pioneered a new research field, Array Databases.\nThe Geological Society of America honoured Ian Jackson with their Outstanding Contributions in Geoinformatics award for 2014. The award recognises an individual who has contributed in an outstanding manner to geology through the application of the principles of geoinformatics.\nIan was a councillor of CGI from 2004 to 2012. Ian understood the importance of standards to achieve the opening of geoscientific data for diverse uses, and took a decisive part in the recreation of the IUGS-CGI.\nThe award citation notes Ian\u0026rsquo;s long and superb service to advance the field of geoinformatics through his pioneering work at the British Geological Survey, to the establishment and unprecedented success of the OneGeology initiative. A dominant theme throughout Ian\u0026rsquo;s career has been the wide application of geoscience data for societal benefit, a goal he continues to promote as a consultant on the international stage. Ian has been one of the first in geological survey organizations worldwide to understand, and more importantly, to change the organization of the survey to fulfill its role of \u0026ldquo;information agency.\u0026rdquo;\nAmong his many accomplishments, Ian is perhaps best known as the primary instigator of OneGeology - a global initiative to make digital geological map data accessible throughout the world. Ian\u0026rsquo;s colleagues uniformly refer to his ability to inspire others on the OneGeology concept and build a strong team with the skills to create OneGeology, his keen awareness of how to get things done, and his ability to find constructive ways around obstacles as key to the success of the initiative.\nNew Working Group Chair Mark Rattenbury from GNS-New Zealand is the new chair of the CGI Geoscience Terminology Working Group. Mark took over from Steve Richard who handed over the reins after many years of inspirational leadership of CGI\u0026rsquo;s vocabulary development team. Mark has extensive experience in geological mapping, particularly of complexly deformed and metamorphosed basement terranes of Australia, Antarctica, and New Zealand. He led the 1:250 000 scale Geological Map of New Zealand programme to its conclusion in 2010 and is a specialist in geological map data management and dissemination using GIS software and web services. Mark is also a participant in the OGC/CGI GeoSciML Standards Working Group, as well as being the New Zealand representative on the OneGeology Technical Implementation Group.\nNew Geoscience Vocabularies The CGI Geoscience Terminology Working Group (GTWG) recently published 18 new geoscience vocabularies at the CGI\u0026rsquo;s vocabulary resources website. The vocabularies describe features of mineral resources such as resource shape and form, exploration and mining activities, and resource and reserve classifications. The GTWG worked in collaboration with the EarthResourceML Working Group to compile the new vocabularies to support the EarthResourceML data transfer standard, most importantly as the standard for mineral resource data transfer for the EU INSPIRE initiative.\nUpcoming Events  35th International Geological Congress, Cape Town\nPreliminary planning has begun within CGI Council for the Geoinformatics Symposium at the 2016 International Geological Congress in Cape Town, South Africa. If you would like to volunteer to help organise the symposium, please contact Kristine Asch.\nNews from South America CGI and OneGeology  \nSeveral CGI members presented at the South American OneGeology workshop in October in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Tim Duffy and Steve Richard outlined how CGI standards such as GeoSciML-Portrayal and CGI\u0026rsquo;s geoscience vocabularies can be used to publish digital map data through the OneGeology Portal. The value of OneGeology as a vehicle to promote data sharing and data standards was emphasised, and Santiago Muñoz Tapia, president of the Ibero-American Geological and Mining Surveys Association (ASGMI), offered to host a future OneGeology/GeoSciML-Portrayal training course in the Dominican Republic.\nCGI in Argentina   Left to right: CGI councillor Gabriel Asato, Dr Ruben Matheos (UnderSecretariat), Dr Cecatto (Secretariat Joint Science Technological, Ministry of Science, Technology and Production Innovation).\nArgentina recently enacted ministerial decisions concerning the development of national science digital repositories. An interview was conducted during 2014 with the Joint Science and Technology Secretariat. Then a meeting with the Secretariat, Dr Alejandro Ceccatto was arranged where the aims and activities of CGI-IUGS were presented to him by CGI councillor Gabriel Asato. Dr Ceccatto was very pleased to know about CGI-IUGS activities and expressed that it could be important to have a geoscience digital information chapter in the national science repositories project.\nCGI 2014 Annual Report The 2014 annual report of CGI to the IUGS is now available from the CGI website. The report describes the broad range of activities undertaken by CGI technical working groups and regional groups in 2014.\nGIRAF at CAG 25 in Dar es Salaam Since its foundation in 2009, the GIRAF network has been present at each Colloquium of African Geology (CAG) with a workshop or a session. A GIRAF workshop was held during 2014 \u0026ldquo;CAG 25\u0026rdquo; and the 3rd YES Network Congress in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

In this edition we welcome three new CGI councillors, and we kick off efforts to coordinate standards for 3D geological models.\nTable of Contents  New Members of CGI Council CGI Working Group News 3D Geological Data Models — a call for participants in a review of 3D standards GeoSciML News News from China News from Africa Featured Project Upcoming Events More Upcoming Events\u0026hellip; Meet Your CGI Councillors Join Us on LinkedIn   New Members of CGI Council Three new members have been elected to CGI Council to replace the recently retired Richard Hughes and to fill two other vacancies. We welcome Kombada Mhopjeni (Geological Survey of Namibia), Zhang Minghua (China Geological Survey), and Santiago Munoz (Geological Survey of the Dominican Republic).\nCGI Working Group News  \nThe Geoscience Terminology Working Group, in collaboration with the EarthResourceML Working Group recently approved the adoption of 18 new vocabularies to support delivery of mineral occurrence and mine data using the EarthResourceML data transfer standard. The vocabularies have been developed in collaboration with the European Union’s Minerals Intelligence Network for Europe (Minerals4EU), so that Minerals4EU vocabularies use either exactly the same terms or have mappings to CGI terminology. The vocabularies are to be published soon through the CGI\u0026rsquo;s vocabulary service.\n3D Geological Data Models — a call for participants in a review of 3D standards  \nBy nature, geological information is 3D (or even 4D). To date, CGI efforts to support geological data interoperability have focused on exchange of geological map and borehole information with GeoSciML and EarthResourceML, using GML as the underlying spatial data engine. With the growing demand for exchanging 3D geological models in many domains (eg, oil and gas, mining, groundwater, design of infrastructure), there is a clear need for standardizing the exchange of 3D models independently of the data format used by the modeling software.\nThere is currently no accepted generic exchange model for 3D geological models, although there have been some attempts in different organizations or projects. The CGI Council considers it a priority for the Commission to\n review the current situation in the delivery of 3D geological models, and propose a strategy for identifying or developing an agreed standard possibly in partnership with other standardization bodies.  We are now calling for volunteers to participate in an ad-hoc group to be setup in CGI on this topic. If you are interested, please email the CGI Chair, Francois Robida.\nGeoSciML News  \nThe joint OGC/CGI GeoSciML Standards Working Group (SWG) has recently held two teleconference meetings – one of them as part of the quarterly OGC Technical Committee meeting in Washington DC. Steve Richard provided a summary of his recent work to document the use cases needed for development of the GeoSciML version 4 standard. The working group will gather together in Tucson, USA from June 29 to July 3 for its annual face-to-face meeting. This will be held in conjunction with similar meetings of the EarthResourceML and Geoscience Terminology working groups, and the OneGeology Technical working group.\n A new user guide for GeoSciML data providers has also just been published by the British Geological Survey as part of their contribution to the EU INSPIRE initiative. The new user guide and other GeoSciML resources can be found on the GeoSciML website.\nNews from China A 1:1 million scale geological map of China has recently been released by the China Geological Survey as a contribution of China to the OneGeology initiative. The 1:1M geological map data cover most of the land areas of China and is now available as a OGC Web Map Service (WMS). Map layers include bedrock lithology, lithostratigraphy and major faults. For further information, contact your CGI councillor from China, Zhang Minghua.\nNews from Africa The 25th Colloquium of African Geology will be held in conjunction with the 3rd Congress of the Young Earth Scientists network (YES) in August 2014, in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

Recognising that the CGI council member will be able only to provide continental scale regional representation, the CGI council recognises the potential need to institute working groups that will address the specialised technical or scientific needs of regions defined by culture, geography or politics and encourages the establishment of CGI Regional Working Groups (RWG).\nRGW Activities RWGs will be required to respect the aims and policies of the CGI as outlined in the CGI Statutes and organise their own activities. In the interests of maintaining a consistent approach across all CGI activities and regions, RGWs must seek CGI Council approval before endorsing as a CGI product or standard, any locally developed standard, tool, or system. Where appropriate, RWGs can play an important role representing and promoting CGI aims and policies at relevant regional conferences, workshops and meetings but must inform CGI council if doing so.\nFunding The CGI is unfortunately unable to provide funding support to RGWs but will work to facilitate their operations wherever possible.\nLiaison with CGI Council CGI council will identify a council member to act as a liaison with the chairman of the RGW. The designated CGI council member will represent the RWG at CGI council meeting and be responsible for keeping their RWG(s) informed of CGI developments. Where appropriate, RGW chairmen may be requested to attend all or part of CGI council meetings.\nApplication Individuals wishing to form a RGW should make a written proposal to the CGI Council including:-\n Identification of the region they propose to represent; Their specific regional issues; Their proposed activities; Identification of a chairman and list of interested individuals and their affiliations; Full contact information for the proposed chairman (phone, address, email, fax).  Where possible, RGWs are encouraged to include as members, individuals from different institutions such as universities, geological surveys and industry. The CGI Council will evaluate proposals to establish RWGs and respond to the designated chairman within three weeks.\n","date":1402570248,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1402570248,"objectID":"44b2781140cabf407e53a4511c609ed3","permalink":"https://cgi-iugs.github.io/project/regionalwg/","publishdate":"2014-06-12T11:50:48+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/regionalwg/","section":"project","summary":"The CGI council recognises the potential need to institute working groups that will address the specialised technical or scientific needs of regions defined by culture, geography or politics and encourages the establishment of CGI Regional Working Groups (RWG).","tags":["active"],"title":"Regional Working Groups","type":"project"},{"authors":["CGI-IUGS"],"categories":["newsletter"],"content":"» View this newsletter as a PDF\nWelcome to the new face of CGI.

However, that does not mean the work of John and the IWG members is over.\nThe IWG\u0026rsquo;s GeoSciML Task Group became a Standards Working Group of the Open Geospatial Consortium in January 2013, chaired by Ollie Raymond of Geoscience Australia. Future development and documentation of GeoSciML will be done under a collaborative arrangement between OGC and CGI.\nDevelopment of the EarthResourceML data transfer standard for mines and mineral occurrences will be continued by a new CGI EarthResourceML Working Group, headed by Jouni Vuollo of the Finnish Geological Survey.\nGeoscience Terminology Working Group The CGI\u0026rsquo;s Geoscience Terminology Working Group is looking for new members to help the global effort to publish multilingual vocabularies to support delivery of standards-based geoscience data.\nIf you would like to contribute to the working group, contact the group\u0026rsquo;s chair, Steve Richard. Read more about the working group.\nEarthResourceML version 2 released Version 2.0 of the CGI data standard for mineral occurrences and mines has been published. XML schemas and documentation are available from the EarthResourceML (ERML) website. A simple features version of the ERML standard - ERML-Portrayal - is also soon to be published by the CGI ERML Working Group. ERML is now fully compatible with the requirements of the European Commission\u0026rsquo;s INSPIRE data specification for Mineral Resources. Geological Surveys in Australia and New Zealand have also endorsed the ERML standard for delivery of mineral occurrence data.\nGeoSciML-Portrayal version 2 released  \nVersion 2 of the GeoSciML-Portrayal simple features WFS data standard was released in August. The schema provides a simple attribute structure for digital map portrayal of geologic units, faults, contacts, and now borehole collar locations. GeoSciML-Portrayal is also recommended for use as an attribute standard for WMS web services. The data standard is endorsed by several international data sharing initiatives, including OneGeology and the US Geoscience Information Network (USGIN). Find out more information on GeoSciML-Portrayal.\nGeoSciML v3.2 \u0026ldquo;cookbook\u0026rdquo; published A new instructional cookbook for GeoSciML web services has been published by CGI and the European Union\u0026rsquo;s INSPIRE Directive. Although the cookbook has been written mostly to address INSPIRE use cases, all users of the GeoSciML data standard will find it a useful guide.\nNew Managing Director for OneGeology Marko Komac, Director of the Geological Survey of Slovenia, vice-president of IUGS, and CGI member, has been appointed as the new Managing Director of OneGeology.\nThe OneGeology initiative is a major partner of CGI in promoting interoperability and delivering geological map data using CGI and OGC data standards. Find out more information about OneGeology.\nNews from Africa  \nThe 3rd GIRAF Workshop took place in Accra, Ghana, from 22nd to 27th of September, coinciding with the centennial celebrations of the Geological Survey of Ghana. 121 participants from 26 African and 7 non-African countries took part. The Geoscience InfoRmation in Africa network (GIRAF) was founded in 2009 and currently has 337 Members from 37 African and 15 non-African countries. GIRAF is governed by the CGI and is supported by the UNESCO.\nThe GIRAF-network brings together African scientists, authorities, national experts and other stakeholders in geoscience. GIRAF provides a platform to address, discuss and raise awareness of what geoscience information can do to - in the long-term - improve the way geoscience information contributes to the health and prosperity of the people in Africa.\nUpcoming Events  \nThe FOSS4G Europe conference and exhibition will be held in Bremen, Germany, 15–17 July 2014. More than 500 delegates are expected to attend Europe\u0026rsquo;s largest ever event on free geospatial and location-based software.

The ultimate objective of the working group was to enable seamless integration over the internet of geological information hosted at different agencies in varied formats. The working group conducted several testbeds to test the viability of technologies and standards within the context of individual agency activities.\nThe specific objectives of the working group were:\n to develop a conceptual model of geoscientific information drawing on existing data models to implement an agreed subset of this model in an agreed schema language implement an XML/GML encoding of the model subset develop a testbed to illustrate the potential of the data model for interchange identify areas that require standardised classifications in order to enable interchange  The Interoperability Working Group comprised several task groups to address specific aspects of the work:\n GeoSciML Design task group designed the GeoSciML data model and XML schemas for transfer of geological data. The work of the GeoSciML task group is being carried forward by the CGI/OGC GeoSciML Standards Working Group. Use Cases and Requirements task group developed technical goals for GeoSciML by describing new use-cases and requirements; Service Architecture task group developed and documented the formal architecture required to deliver GeoSciML services Implementation Testbed task group coordinated interoperability testbeds using GeoSciML; Geoscience Concept Definitions task group was responsible for designing vocabulary services that satisfy the requirements of GeoSciML. The work of this task group has been merged with the Multilingual Thesaurus Working Group into the Geoscience Terminology Working Group. Outreach and Technical Assistance task group provided advice and assistance to direct collaborators, assisting them to deploy conformant GeoSciML Services. EarthResourceML task group developed the CGI data model for mineral occurrences and mines data, based on the Australia/NZ mineral deposits model. This task group has now been elevated to a CGI working group.  Material developed by the Interoperability Working Group, including the GeoSciML and EarthResourceML UML models, XML/GML schemas, instance documents, documentation, and vocabularies are available through the GeoSciML, EarthResourceML, and Geoscience Terminology Working Group web pages.\n","date":1371034261,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1371034261,"objectID":"d9e090c1313da531c16f8cfda30a7910","permalink":"https://cgi-iugs.github.io/project/interoperabilitywg/","publishdate":"2013-06-12T11:51:01+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/interoperabilitywg/","section":"project","summary":"The Interoperability Working Group was formed to develop data standards to facilitate the query and exchange of geological information between data providers for environmental, scientific, legal and social purposes.
