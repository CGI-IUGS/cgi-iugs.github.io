&lt;h2 id="feb-24th-geoinfo-summit--harvey-thorleifson">Feb 24th GeoInfo Summit – Harvey Thorleifson&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/newsletter8/01Zoom.jpg" alt="GeoInfo Summit participants, May 19th">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/newsletter8/02HarveyThorleifson.jpg" alt="Harvey Thorleifson">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CGI is the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) Commission for the Management and Application of Geoscience Information. The goal of CGI is to foster the interoperability and exchange of geoscience information, through community leadership, collaboration, education, as well as development and promotion of standards and best practices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On 24 February 2022, at 10 AM UTC, CGI and partner agencies hosted a 3-hour online GeoInfo Summit attended by geoscience information leaders from around the world. CGI Chair Harvey Thorleifson stated that geoscience information is of escalating importance to worldwide society, with increasing emphasis on standardized, machine-readable, data-rich knowledge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He noted that respected international geoscience information organizations happily support each other, and we are coordinating our plans, for example as we prepare for upcoming high-level IUGS meetings. He was pleased that there had been unanimous support for this joint, informal meeting, which had not included ambitious pre-meeting effort.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were talks from CGI, CGI Work Groups, CGMW, Codata, DDE, Loop, OGC, OneGeology, and CGI Planning. Speakers had been asked to present an overview of their background, status, and plans, as well as mention of leadership recruitment, government-university-industry coordination, ensuring sustainability, and defining coordinated and achievable goals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Harvey expressed appreciation to the speakers whose presentations are summarized here. Subsequently, on May 19th, a GeoInfo Summit discussion session was held.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cgi--françois-robida">CGI – François Robida&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/newsletter8/03FrancoisRobida.jpg" alt="François Robida">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>François, CGI Past Chair, described how CGI, which focuses on geoscience while benefiting from broader Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) arrangements, emanated from a 2003 Edinburgh meeting of geological survey and industry people, when multiple geological data model initiatives in the context of new standards such as GML, WMS, and WFS resulted in a consensus to build a common model that would permit the interoperability that is essential for humans and machines to conduct data-driven science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To overcome the tendency for everyone to reinvent their own standard, he asserted that we must work together on standards that will be built by recognized and respected, broadly knowledgeable scientists, data scientists, and technical experts, and that are needed, endorsed, and used by the community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>François stressed the need to manage scientists’ tendency to over-specify complexity, to improve or extend existing standards, to reconcile standards in related fields such as multiple borehole standards, to import procedures from related fields such as 3D, to publicize our work broadly, and to validate our work through testbeds and flagships, through an open consensus-building process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2022, he sees a need for renewed coordination among geoscience information organizations, in part by clarifying complementary roles, as well as with industry and academia, as we did in 2003, although we now have a new context such as semantic web, linked data, big data, AI, and 3D, and a need for us to coordinate with ocean and atmosphere. In closing, François stated that we can do nothing without standards.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cgi-work-groups--harvey-thorleifson">CGI Work Groups – Harvey Thorleifson&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To praise superb work by CGI Work Groups and partner groups, Harvey presented a summary of the CGI webinar that had been held in June 2021, that is available on YouTube, and that was summarized in the August 2021 CGI Newsletter. He also mentioned the September 2021 technical seminar on geoscience ontology and knowledge graph that also is available on YouTube. In addition, he described the comprehensive, 15-hour DDE Geoscience Standards Training in October 2021, for which videos are available on the DDE web site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He described how the OGC Geoscience Domain Working Group (DWG) partners with CGI and others to make geoscience information findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Key DWG goals are interoperability, data definitions, formats, and services for publishing, search, and exchange; thematic/semantic coherence with related domains; interfaces with city/infrastructure and risk domains; showing value added by interoperability; best practices; and standards for spatial and temporal features, metadata, and other information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, an OGC Standard Working Group (SWG) manages GeoSciML (Geoscience Markup Language), an XML- and GML-based machine-readable format for geological maps. EarthResourceML (ERML) is a markup language for the delivery of mineral occurrence, deposit, mining, and resource data. Nineteen ERML vocabularies include mine status, commodity, and reserves; data delivery and implementation are well accommodated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CGI Geoscience Terminology Working Group maintains terms for earth features, properties, quantities, techniques, and processes that are agreed upon and made widely accessible, including to machines. Geoscience ontology research is being conducted in association with Loop. The Deep-time Digital Earth (DDE) Standards Task Group (DDE-STG) is facilitating adoption of CGI standards and terminology by DDE, the first IUGS-recognized big science programme that was launched in 2019.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cgmw--manuel-pubellier-and-benjamin-sautter">CGMW – Manuel Pubellier and Benjamin Sautter&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/newsletter8/04ManuelPubellier.jpg" alt="Manuel Pubellier">
&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/newsletter8/05BenjaminSautter.jpg" alt="Benjamin Sautter">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Manuel, with Benjamin Sautter, provided an update on the work of the Commission for the Geological Map of the World (CGMW), an international non-profit association governed by French law that is responsible for designing, coordinating, preparing, and publishing small-scale thematic earth science maps of the globe, continents, major regions, and oceans. CGMW was established as an outcome of the International Geological Congress (IGC), first held in 1878. The commission was conceived in 1910 at the 11th IGC in Stockholm, and established in 1913 at the 12th IGC in Toronto.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CGMW has several thematic sub-commissions, and an important role in preserving the legacy of important paper maps produced over a century and more, while using current technology to produce the geological mapping databases that are needed for our future. The maps need to be freely accessible on an international basis, and at the same time, someone has to pay. CGMW is working, particularly with CGI and OneGeology, to take forward thinking on development of global seamless 3D databases at multiple levels of resolution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An exciting and important current activity is a new 1:5M seamless geological map of the world, being produced in association with DDE, including much reconciliation aided by imagery and elevation databases, and updated bathymetry and seafloor geology, including mid-oceanic ridges, transforms, seafloor age, and hydrothermal vents.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="codata--alena-rybkina">Codata – Alena Rybkina&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/newsletter8/06AlenaRybkina.jpg" alt="Alena Rybkina">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Alena described the role of Codata, the Committee on Data of the International Science Council, in building a foundation for a world of open data, by promoting open science and FAIR data. CODATA convenes a global expert community and provides a forum for international consensus building and agreements around a range of data science and data policy issues, from the fundamental physical constants to cross-domain data specifications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Codata has national committees, scientific union members, institutional members, and partner organizations. Codata advances data policies, data science, data skills, and data documentation. While citing a report on Advancing Science as a Global Public Good, she stated that the major, pressing global scientific and human issues of the 21st century can only be addressed through research that works across disciplines to understand complex systems, and which uses a transdisciplinary approach. She noted that there are major challenges for many scientific domains that require work on data specifications, semantics, infrastructures, and more, as estimates imply 80% of our effort is spent on data wrangling, due to suboptimal data stewardship.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nevertheless, much cross-domain collaboration is quickening, to address current global grand challenges. Alena then outlined the FAIR guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship, and a document on Turning FAIR into reality. The Codata data documentation initiative is a cross-domain integration collaboration designed to interface with other standards and to help interoperability between different data types, standards, and formats.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="dde--junxuan-fan">DDE – Junxuan Fan&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/newsletter8/07JunxuanFan.jpg" alt="Junxuan Fan">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Junxuan Fan described DDE, for which the kick-off meeting was held at Beijing in February 2019, with representatives of 40 geoscience organizations in attendance, and with 12 founding organizations signing the accord to initiate the DDE program. DDE is a big science program dedicated to facilitating innovation in understanding the Earth&amp;rsquo;s evolution and applications as well as the Sustainable Development Goals utilizing Big Data analytics, internet cloud computing, data mining, machine learning, and AI. The principal theme is harmonizing global deep time geoscience data. The governance includes a governing council, executive committee, science council, science communities, working groups, and task groups. The primary goals are to establish an international consortium, linking isolated databases into an open, distributed system, making data FAIR, linking earth spheres, and promoting innovative earth system research, through data-driven knowledge discovery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DDE data-driven knowledge discovery is addressing: 1. Integrating a uniform high-resolution earth time system; 2. Origin and evolution of life and biodiversity; 3. How did sedimentary matter evolve and cycle?; 4. Reconstructing earth climate and atmosphere history from big data of multiple geochemical indices; 5. Global sea-level change through deep time; 6. Quantifying plate tectonics and deformation in 4D; 7. 4D architecture and evolution of deep-earth materials and dynamics; 8. Mineral evolution beyond 4D; 9. A globally shared big-data energy resource system for sustainable development; 10. Geophysical fields for prediction of seismic hazard.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="loop--laurent-ailleres">Loop – Laurent Ailleres&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/newsletter8/08LaurentAilleres.jpg" alt="Laurent Ailleres">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Laurent described Loop, an integrated and interoperable platform enabling 3D stochastic geological modelling. The focus of Loop is on providing solutions for subsurface resource management, managing geological knowledge, 3D geological and geophysical modelling, as well as uncertainty risk mitigation. Loop knowledge management is using AI for knowledge extraction from literature, maps, and reports using geological ontology, with geological rules being encoded to ensure proper knowledge extraction.
Loop is a time-aware geological modelling platform, and the geological event management is capturing topological and time relationships between geological objects and structural events. Loop forward and inverse structural modelling is encoding structural geological rules in a time-aware context to account for folds, faults, shear zones, unconformities and intrusions. The modelling is based on probabilistic modelling and allows for the definition of an objective function for geology and quantification of uncertainty via posterior probabilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A milestone was reached recently with release of the GeoScience Ontology (GSO). In addition, Map2Loop data pre-processing and input now involves automation of data input for Loop modelling methods, geometrical analysis of geological maps, and topological analysis of the map. Secondary geological information automatically derived from maps includes normalized local formation thickness, and apparent fault throw. Loop Resources involves reducing the mining footprint with curvilinear geostatistics using structural frames.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plans for the future include Loop Vision, an interoperable, integrative, automated and update-able workflow to model geology based on structural geological rules and geophysics. A platform will integrate geophysical modelling/constraints upstream with structural geological modelling/constraints. Loop provides a means to characterize and mitigate uncertainty that will guide further data acquisition. The framework accommodates lithology, alteration, mineralogy, metallurgy, geotechnical parameters, and grades, allowing a better characterization of mining block and process optimization.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ogc--mickaël-beaufils">OGC – Mickaël Beaufils&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/newsletter8/09Micka%C3%ABlBeaufils.jpg" alt="Mickaël Beaufils">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mickaël provided an overview of OGC and the GeoScience DWG, that partners with CGI and many other organizations in making geospatial information findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). For findability, he cited persistent identifiers (PIDs), rich metadata, indexed data repositories, and PIDs in metadata; for accessibility, he cited standard communication protocols, open and free protocols, authentication where necessary, and metadata always available; for interoperability, he cited vocabularies, FAIR vocabularies, and linked metadata; and for reusability, he cited multiple attribute metadata, usage licenses, provenance, and community standards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He outlined the OGC innovation continuum, in which an innovation cycle links to a standardization cycle. The innovation cycle involves project identification, call for sponsors, creation of a public call, selection of members, an executive project, and generation of results. This links to the standardization cycle, built on domain and standards working groups, involving DWG discussion, SWG formation, standards development, DWG/SWG presentations, formulation of enhancements, and interest gathering, which links back to the innovation cycle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Key DWG goals are interoperability, data definitions, formats, and services for publishing, search, and exchange; thematic/semantic coherence with related domains; interfaces with city/infrastructure and risk domains; showing value added by interoperability; best practices; and standards for spatial and temporal features, metadata, and other information. Emphasis has been on the BhML borehole conceptual model, as well as (Geo)JSON(- LD), 3D-4D, BIM, geotechnics, ISO19156 for observations and measurements, OGC SensorThings API, OGC-API features, and SMART Data Loader. Much emphasis is now on geotech interoperability.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="onegeology--matt-harrison">OneGeology – Matt Harrison&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/newsletter8/10MattHarrison.jpg" alt="Matt Harrison">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Matt spoke on OneGeology, which has 189 member organizations, and is dedicated to providing geoscience data globally. OneGeology technical principles are based on interoperability with emphasis on GeoSciML, data on distributed servers sent directly to the web client, participants delivering map data through a standard OGC web service, cookbooks and online help and buddy systems so all nations can serve their data, a central catalog of services, and a portal that can display and aggregate all of the maps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to the 2007 Brighton Accord, OneGeology is a geological survey initiative that will make public and internet-accessible the best available digital geological map data, with priority on interoperable, Internet-accessible, scientifically-attributed data and to make progress at levels appropriate to participants&amp;rsquo; capability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OneGeology is now migrating its focus to the application, technology and opportunities arising from developing a multiscale suite of digital twin earth system models. These will enable the better prediction and understanding of subsurface processes and their properties, and how these influence the world around us. The existence and use of an earth system digital twin could, for example, allow users to sample a volume of rock and run numerical simulations to understand the impacts of various inputs and changes to that system, such as alternative energy storage technologies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These digital twin models will be an ensemble of 4D geospatial data, models, and visualizations. One of the key elements will be the cyber–physical interaction, whereby sensor perturbation monitored in the real world will ultimately be reflected within the virtual twin model in near-real time. A realistic model of the natural environment will provide new virtual opportunities to test and improve our understanding of these systems and to model and predict their behaviors into the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cgi-renewal--mark-rattenbury">CGI renewal – Mark Rattenbury&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/newsletter8/11MarkRattenbury.jpg" alt="Mark Rattenbury">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As an illustration of planning and renewal, Mark, a CGI Councilor, discussed how CGI has initiated draft steps toward renewal. He described how the Commission for the Management and Application of Geoscience Information (CGI) is a Commission of the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS), and is an international scientific, technical non-governmental, non-political, and non-profit-making organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mark then outlined how CGI aims to: help in exchanging knowledge on geoscience information and systems; support dissemination of best practice in geoscience information; encourage the development of geoscience information standards; play a full part in the international geoscience information community and represent IUGS on geoscience information matters; bring together individuals and organizations with an interest in the management and application of geoscience information; and provide open access to the standards and outputs it delivers, for the benefit of all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He then noted that CGI: has been very successful and influential since its inception; has worked widely across the international community; has led with development of the GeoSciML and EarthResourceML data; has led model standards for information transfer with publishing of internationally agreed geoscience vocabularies; and continues to support these and other initiatives such as OGC&amp;rsquo;s Geoscience Domain Working Group and IUGS&amp;rsquo;s Deep-time Digital Earth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He further described how CGI collaborates on focused projects; provides continuity between peaks in project activities; and offers trusted, stable and enduring governance capability to the geoscience information community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He then suggested that CGI should: assess the maturity of current geoscience information standards; identify opportunities that lie ahead in the geoscience information standards domain; signal what could be achieved in the next four years; signal what could be achieved in the next ten years; and identify collaborators and resources that could help achieve the goals.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="geoinfo-summit-discussion-session--harvey-thorleifson">GeoInfo Summit discussion session – Harvey Thorleifson&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The 90-minute GeoInfo Summit discussion session on May 19th at 10 UTC was a great success. Partner organization leaders noted that technical challenges cannot be addressed by a single organization. We need to address societal challenges, to attract young people, and to work efficiently. Leaders stressed the importance of concrete products. We emphasized the need for a shared vision that we all can rally around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We asserted that we need to be needed, by making sure that our activity is relevant, in part by utilizing new capabilities. We stressed sustainability of our activity, and efficiency through coordination. We stated that standards are maintained if used, and we need to find a problem that calls for what we do. We thus saw the need for a community that uses what we do, with standards reaching critical mass.
We then talked about how to go forward. We noted that in-person meetings allow serendipity, social interaction, and meeting people. We then focused on a global solid earth digital twin as a focal point, perhaps to be a highlight of upcoming IUGS meetings. We saw that we need a workshop that reaches conclusions. We understand that we need a goal, for initial delivery at the IGC in 2024.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was noted that a global solid earth digital twin would be inclusive of everyone, under a ‘Save the Planet’ sort of banner that attracts young people, for very legitimate reasons. We discussed the concurrent digital twin of the oceans, and there was mention of soil/geology coordination. We recognized that we should not promise something by a date, or stress that major funding should come first – but rather we need a roadmap for what each organization needs to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In closing, Harvey Thorleifson noted that we are operating as a multi-agency network, so each agency would have to respect its governance. He suggested that we plan for additional multi-agency, online meetings in September, to take the next step in bringing the solid earth digital twin concept into focus, for example in coordination with DDE.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="future-events">Future Events&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>On September 20-21, 2022, for 90 minutes each day at 10 UTC, we will hold GeoInfo Summit Follow-Up, to be attended by leaders of global geoscience information organizations.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="ogc-geoscience-domain--mickaël-beaufils">OGC Geoscience Domain – Mickaël Beaufils&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/newsletter7/mb.png" alt="Mickaël Beaufils">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mickael Beaufils of BRGM spoke as Chair of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Geoscience Domain Working Group (DWG), that partners with CGI and many other organizations in making spatial information findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For findability, he cited persistent identifiers (PIDs), rich metadata, indexed data repositories, and PIDs in metadata; for accessibility, he cited standard communication protocols, open and free protocols, authentication where necessary, and metadata always available; for interoperability, he cited vocabularies, FAIR vocabularies, and linked metadata; and for reusability, he cited multiple attribute metadata, usage licenses, provenance, and community standards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Key DWG goals are: interoperability, data definitions, formats, and services for publishing, search, and exchange; thematic/semantic coherence with related domains; interfaces with city/infrastructure and risk domains; showing value added by interoperability; best practices; and standards for spatial and temporal features, metadata, and other information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Emphasis has been on the BhML borehole conceptual model, as well as (Geo)JSON(- LD), 3D-4D, BIM, geotechnics, ISO19156 for observations and measurements, OGC SensorThings API, OGC-API features, and SMART Data Loader.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The DWG has been active since being conceived at Dublin in 2016; the next meeting is in September.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="geosciml--éric-boisvert">GeoSciML – Éric Boisvert&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/newsletter7/eb.png" alt="Éric Boisvert">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Éric Boisvert of the Geological Survey of Canada spoke on behalf of the OGC Standard Working Group (SWG) for GeoSciML (Geoscience Markup Language), an XML- and GML-based machine-readable format for geological maps that has been stable for almost two decades since emanating from work such as XMML, NADM, and G-XML. Although V1 in 2005 was monolithic, V2 in 2009 had properties grouped, with boreholes and fossils added.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>V3 in 2012 was packaged as 13 schemas, with themes added, OGC versions of some dependencies, custom elements dropped, external vocabularies, and explicit nil required. V4 in 2015, packaged as basic and extended, became OGC V4.1 in 2017, with reversion to optional properties, profiling, and Portrayal (Lite) integrated. The scope covers geology, including boreholes and specimens, with limited applicability to specialized domains, or symbology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>GeoSciML Lite, based on simple features and thus comparable to a SHP file, is widely compatible, although with limited expressiveness, and thus limited to simple applications. Extensions include GroundwaterML2, EarthResourceML, and geotechnics for civil engineering. OGC, and thus GeoSciML, is transitioning from XML to JSON (OGC API); future work will address knowledge encoding such as RDF and ontologies.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="earthresourceml--michael-sexton">EarthResourceML – Michael Sexton&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/newsletter7/ms.png" alt="Michael Sexton">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Michael Sexton of Geoscience Australia provided an overview of EarthResourceML (ERML), a markup language for the delivery of mineral occurrence, deposit, mining, and resource data that was initiated in 2006 as a collaboration between Australian state and federal agencies. The name was adopted and a CGI working group formed in 2010.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ERML is an extension of GeoSciML, with a mineral occurrence being a subtype of Geologic Feature; the mining feature types of ERML are not part of GeoSciML.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The earth resource concept encompasses geology, economics, environment, and society. Through international collaboration, ERML has a minimum set of features and attributes for describing and communicating information about earth resources in a standardized way. Nineteen CGI vocabularies include mine status, commodity, and reserves; data delivery and implementation are well accommodated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ERML v3, which is near completion, has an improved resources model to represent resources as reported, addition of processing plants, and removal of mandatory attributes and relationships. ERML v3 will have GeoServer feature templating and a smart data loader, with JSON outputs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="cgi-geoscience-vocabularies--mark-rattenbury">CGI Geoscience Vocabularies – Mark Rattenbury&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/newsletter7/mr.png" alt="Mark Rattenbury">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mark Rattenbury of GNS Science in New Zealand, Te Pū Ao, spoke for the CGI Geoscience Terminology Working Group, which has been separate from the GeoSciML group since 2014, and which maintain lists of terms for earth features, properties, quantities, techniques, and processes that are collaboratively agreed upon and are widely accessible, including to machines. The terminology conveys unambiguous meaning, offers translations, reduces confusion, utilizes natural hierarchies, and supports data models.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Working Group supports interoperability, develops and enables vocabularies, has 30 members in 16 countries, collaborates with partner groups, has had six face-to-face meetings, and has had much online interaction. A formal vocabulary development and adoption process is used. The vocabularies are somewhat FAIR, but there are many competing vocabularies. Ideally, CGI vocabularies will be better known and more widely used, because they are international, they support data models, and they are supported through enduring governance. Working Group priorities are to publish remaining vocabularies identified by working groups, update published vocabularies, add multilingual terms, and promote application of CGI vocabularies, especially in academic and industry contexts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Challenges include aligning to international projects, finding time to make progress, and pandemic-related restrictions on travel.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="loop-geoscience-ontology--boyan-brodaric-and-stephen-richard">Loop GeoScience Ontology – Boyan Brodaric and Stephen Richard&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/newsletter7/bb.png" alt="Boyan Brodaric">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Boyan Brodaric of the Geological Survey of Canada, and Stephen Richard of the USGIN Foundation in USA, reported on GeoScience Ontology (GSO) research being conducted in association with Loop, an integrated and interoperable platform enabling 3D stochastic geological modeling. Knowledge management at present is a very active topic, due to the activities of Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and others. The Google Knowledge Graph initially released in 2016, the basis for their infobox, is built on a schema.org ontology, and a query API such as SPARQL.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The GSO incorporates a framework with entities, relations, and rules, as well as an OWL2 language. The GSO builds on NADM, GeoSciML, and DOLCE Rocks, and work in several ongoing projects. In association with GeoSciML, the activity includes, for example, an OWL conceptual schema and re-conceptualization, UML logical schema, XSD application schema, and XML instance documents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Development will have to be broad and deep, modular, and standalone. The modular organization will be a layercake ontology, from common, to geology, to modules. Context dependency is an important concept, and relations include fundamental, spatial, temporal, and geological. Next steps include public feedback, knowledge repository testing, and integration with Loop 3D modeling code.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="dde-standards-task-group--zhang-minghua">DDE Standards Task Group – Zhang Minghua&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/newsletter7/zm.png" alt="Zhang Minghua">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Zhang Minghua of the China Geological Survey, Co-Secretary General of CGI, described the work of the Deep-time Digital Earth Standards Task Group (DDE-STG). DDE is an IUGS big science program focused on data-driven discovery regarding the evolution of life, matter, geography, and climate. DDE will be an international consortium that will link databases, make data FAIR, unify earth science, and promote research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The kickoff meeting at Beijing in February 2019 was attended by representatives of 40 geoscience organizations, and founding organizations signed an accord. The DDE roadmap encompasses the 2019 accord, formal launch in 2020, midterm reporting in 2024, and final reporting in 2028. For the geoscience knowledge system, DDE has adopted CGI terminology, and knowledge system graphs have been in development since 2019.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The DDE-STG, now consisting of 28 leading professionals who held their first in-person meeting in January 2020, will now work in close collaboration with CGI and partners such as CODATA, to coordinate standards identification and development, survey stakeholders, develop the metadata standard based on ISO19115-2014(E), oversee review of the semantic knowledge system, provide advice to DDE working groups, provide training, and maintain the portfolio of standards.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Prof Zhang presented the DDE-STG work, achievements and 2021 work plan based on the DDE-STG annual proposal, submitted in November 2020, on behalf of the of DDE-STG. Four main activities for 2021 are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>DDE knowledge system review report;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Standards training courses;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>DDE metadata standard (draft version);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Working Teams for DDE geosciences data standards.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The discussions included coverage of a variety of issues/topics such as the DDE data and knowledge groups, geological timeline, global 1:5million map, Eurasian margin sea and DDE-China and CODATA roles on open science facilities. Standards including metadata standards, DDE standards architecture, and disciplinary specified standards, etc were requested. These requests are critical and helpful, and will direct the work of the DDE-STG.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="a-busy-time-for-cgi">A Busy Time for CGI&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>May and June was a busy time for many CGI members. Three of CGI&amp;rsquo;s standards working groups, the CGI Council, the OneGeology Technical Implementation Group, and the 32nd annual Geoscience Information Consortium (GIC) conference all met over a period of two weeks in Vienna, Austria and Orleans, France.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="geosciml-standards-working-group">GeoSciML Standards Working Group&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/geosciml.jpg" alt="GeoSciML logo">&lt;br>
&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/ogc_logo.jpg" alt="OGC logo">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The OGC/CGI GeoSciML Standards Working Group (SWG) held its
&lt;a href="http://external.opengeospatial.org/twiki_public/GeoSciMLswg/ViennaFace2FaceJune2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annual face-to-face meeting&lt;/a> at Geologische Bundesanstalt (Geological Survey of Austria) in Vienna in May. This was the first meeting since the GeoSciML v4.1 data standard was ratified and
&lt;a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/pressroom/pressreleases/2563" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published by OGC&lt;/a> in March. All current documentation and schemas are now hosted on the
&lt;a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/geosciml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OGC website&lt;/a>. The original
&lt;a href="http://www.geosciml.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CGI website&lt;/a> still maintains access to all historic versions of GeoSciML and links to other supporting resources like UML models and
&lt;a href="http://resource.geosciml.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vocabularies&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After 8 years as Chair of the Working Group, Ollie Raymond stepped down and Eric Boisvert (pictured) from the Geological Survey of Canada has taken on the role. We wish Eric and the team every success as the SWG enters a new phase in GeoSciML development. The working group discussed minor corrections to the version 4.1 standard, considered a GML version 3.2 profile of GeoSciML-Lite, and reviewed the best practice of delivering data using the GeoSciML-Lite data standard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Members also considered the future direction of the SWG, in particular towards potential new standard encodings of the GeoSciML data model, such as RDF and JSON.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The annual EarthResourceML (ERML) Working Group meeting was held in June in Orleans, France, hosted by BRGM. CGI members from France, Finland, Australia and New Zealand attended the one day meeting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The working group discussed a proposal from Geoscience Australia for a modification to way that the ERML-Lite data standard delivers commodity resource and reserve amounts. This request was based on the Australian and New Zealand experience of recently establishing the world&amp;rsquo;s first
&lt;a href="http://services.ga.gov.au/earthresource/ows?service=wfs&amp;amp;version=1.1.0&amp;amp;request=GetCapabilities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ERML-Lite WFS services&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The EU-funded
&lt;a href="http://www.prosumproject.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProSum project&lt;/a> also presented a proposal to extend the ERML full model. The proposal will add Processing Activity and Processing Plant to the model. Other technical changes, including links to GeoSciML v4 and implementing recent GeoSciML modelling patterns, will be added to the EarthResourceML and after a review and voting period, a new version ERML v 3.0 will be published later in 2017.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/erml-logo.jpg" alt="ERML logo">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CGI intends to have a strong presence at the
&lt;a href="http://rfg2018.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RFG2018 conference&lt;/a> in Vancouver in June 2018, in particular to promote ERML and ERML-Lite to North America. New ERML and ERML-Lite implementations and use cases will be demonstrated there. Documentation and schemas for EarthResourceML v2.0 and EarthResourceML-Lite v1.0 are available on the

&lt;p>The CGI Geoscience Terminology Working Group (GTWG) met for its fourth face-to-face meeting at the Geological Survey of Austria in Vienna on May 26. Twenty-two people participated in person or remotely. Several key vocabularies that are in advanced stages of preparation have been prioritised for completion, notably the Natural Geomorphologic Feature, Mineral Deposit Type and Regional Lithological Unit Synthesis vocabularies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A presentation by Chris Schubert from the Austrian Climate Change Centre outlined development on federated registries of vocabularies in Europe, and has helped confirm that GTWG’s role in providing globally-relevant geoscience terms that can work in parallel with geological surveys’ more local vocabulary requirements.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/CCOP_workshop_2017.jpg" alt="CCOP Workshop on IGDP and Compilation Technology">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The workshop included training for CCOP member countries on data processing techniques for geological, geophysical and geochemical data. Twenty participants from Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam and the CCOP Technical Secretariat joined a discussion on OneGeology geological map data delivery technologies, and regional geoscience map compilation techniques. A work plan for the next two years was prepared.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="information-sharing-for-the-belt-and-route-region">Information Sharing for the &amp;lsquo;Belt and Route Region&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A seminar was held at the China Geological Survey in Beijing on 16–20 May, 2017, aimed at geoscience information sharing amongst the vast region of the so-called the &amp;lsquo;Belt and Route Region&amp;rsquo;. The region, coined by the Chinese government, covers part or all of Oceania, Asia, Europe, Arab and Africa. More than 50 officials and experts from different geological organisations exchanged views and shared current technology for data exchange and information sharing. CGI-IUGS standards and the CCOP metadata standard will be used for data transfer once the cooperation project application is approved by the Chinese government.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="http://www.geosciml.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeoSciML&lt;/a> data transfer standard was recently accepted by a unanimous vote of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Technical Committee. This significant milestone cements GeoSciML&amp;rsquo;s place as the international geological data transfer standard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Documentation and schemas for GeoSciML version 4.1 will be available on the OGC and &lt;a href="http://www.geosciml.org">www.geosciml.org&lt;/a> websites early in 2017. Due to some changes required by the OGC review process, GeoSciML will move from version 4.0 to version 4.1. The most significant change in version 4.1 is the renaming of &lt;strong>GeoSciML-Portrayal&lt;/strong> to &lt;strong>GeoSciML-Lite&lt;/strong> to avoid confusion with use of the word &amp;lsquo;portrayal&amp;rsquo; in other standards domains. The only other changes from version 4.0 to 4.1 are minor bug fixes and improvements to documentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/ogc_logo.jpg" alt="OGC logo">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The considerable documentation required for OGC accreditation was compiled by Eric Boisvert of the Geological Survey of Canada, with assistance from Ollie Raymond (Geoscience Australia) and Marcus Sen (British Geological Survey). Many thanks for a great effort!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="earthresourceml-lite">EarthResourceML-Lite&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A new abridged, simple feature (WFS SF-0) version of the
&lt;a href="http://www.earthresourceml.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EarthResourceML&lt;/a> data model was released by CGI in August 2016. EarthResourceML-Lite (or ERML-Lite) can be used to deliver simplified views on mineral occurrences and their commodities, mines, mining activities and mine waste products.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/erml-logo.jpg" alt="ERML logo">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ERML-Lite has a similar purpose to GeoSciML-Lite, in that it enables delivery of a simplified view of the full EarthResourceML model which can be used for exchange of data in simple formats that can be easily rendered in GIS applications and web mapping portals (e.g., WMS, simple WFS, shapefiles, CSV tables).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="2016-iugs-science-excellence-award">2016 IUGS Science Excellence Award&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/steve_richard_home_page.jpg" alt="Dr Stephen Richard">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dr Stephen Richard, recently of the Arizona Geological Survey and now at Columbia University, USA, was awarded the 2016 IUGS Science Excellence Award in Geoscience Information at the 35th Intern-ational Geological Congress.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Steve was a research geologist and Head of Geoinformatics at the Arizona Geological Survey from 1992 until 2016, but his influence on North American and international geoinformatics extends way beyond the borders of Arizona. Steve was a leading member of the North American Geological Map Data Model (NADM) Steering Committee from 2000 to 2007. He worked with this consortium of American and Canadian geoscientists, database designers, and developers of geologic map information to develop a comprehensive geological data model that would form one of the foundations for global standards development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Steve was a founding member of the CGI Interoperability Working Group in 2004. As part of this group, Steve was a leading force for over 10 years in the development of the GeoSciML standard for geoscience data transfer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Steve has also been deeply involved in development of international geoscience vocabularies through the IUGS CGI Controlled Vocabularies Working Group, and was the founding Chair of the CGI Geoscience Terminology Working Group. Over 30 internationally-agreed vocabularies were published under Steve&amp;rsquo;s leadership.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Steve has also been a leader in technical development of the US Geoscience Information Network (USGIN) - especially as chief architect of the US National Geothermal Data System - to deploy web services for geoscience information exchange. His advocacy of OGC and CGI standards in US geological surveys has led to these global standards being embedded in North American data delivery best practice.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="geoscience-vocabularies">Geoscience Vocabularies&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Geoscience Terminology Working Group (GTWG) has been working away compiling key vocabularies to support the GeoSciML and EarthResourceML geoscience data models. The
&lt;a href="http://resource.geosciml.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CGI vocabulary service&lt;/a> has been hosted by CSIRO in Australia from its inception, but is soon to be migrated onto a server hosted by Geoscience Australia. The GTWG is very appreciative of the efforts of CSIRO in developing and maintaining the vocabulary service for over a decade and thanks Geoscience Australia for agreeing to support the service into the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The important
&lt;a href="http://resource.geosciml.org/static/vocabulary/earthresourceml/2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commodity Code vocabulary&lt;/a> was compiled and adopted in 2015; a highly hierarchically organised vocabulary of 291 terms describing natural and processed earth resource commodities. This vocabulary is showcased in the
&lt;a href="http://minerals4eu.brgm-rec.fr/minerals4EU/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minerals4EU Map Viewer&lt;/a> web application for mineral commodities around Europe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/minerals4EU.jpg" alt="Minerals4EU Map Viewer">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The EarthResourceML vocabularies have been translated into 22 other European languages through the INSPIRE directive and these multi-lingual vocabularies will be adapted for delivery through the CGI vocabulary service. Many more vocabularies are still required, particularly for the Extension schema of the GeoSciML model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Working Group is always looking for more active members to contribute to compilation of geoscience vocabularies, particularly in languages other than English. Contact the group&amp;rsquo;s chair, compose(&amp;lsquo;M.Rattenbury&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;gns&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;cri.nz&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Mark Rattenbury&amp;rsquo;);, if you would like to contribute to the work.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A successful &amp;ldquo;Geoscience Data &amp;amp; Information Systems&amp;rdquo; symposium was held at the 35th International Geological Congress in Cape Town in August. Over 40 presentations were given on a wide range of digital geological data management, data analysis, and data delivery topics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More than 20 people attended the CGI workshop on geoscience web services. Presentations were given by the leaders of all the CGI working groups, and experts from the OneGeology and INSPIRE projects.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="cgi-members-honoured">CGI Members Honoured&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Three members of CGI have recently been honoured with awards from international information management and data standards organisations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/XiaogangMa.jpg" alt="Dr Xiaogang (Marshall) Ma">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Dr Xiaogang (Marshall) Ma&lt;/strong> was awarded the
&lt;a href="https://www.icsu-wds.org/news/news-archive/wds-stewardship-award-201320132014" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Data System (WDS-ICSU) Data Stewardship Award&lt;/a> for 2014 at the SciDataCon 2014 Conference in New Delhi. The award highlights exceptional contributions to the improvement of scientific data stewardship by early career researchers through their engagement with the community, academic achievements, and innovations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Marshall is a geoinformatics and data science researcher with extensive research in geoscience ontologies, and has worked recently on the capture and representation of data provenance in scientific workflows. Marshall is a member of the CGI Geoscience Terminology Working Group, the International Association for Mathematical Geosciences (IAMG; founder and first president of IAMG&amp;rsquo;s student chapter in 2010), the American Geophysical Union, and the Federation of Earth Science Information Partners. Marshall was coordinator for the GeoData 2014 workshop (highlighting inter-agency data networks in the US), and the 2014 Deep Carbon Observatory Data Science Day symposium, and organizer of a data provenance session for the Association of American Geographers 2014 Annual Meeting.

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/peterBaumann.jpg" alt="Dr Peter Baumann">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Dr Peter Baumann&lt;/strong>, Professor of Computer Science at Jacobs University and a current CGI council member, was awarded the
&lt;a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/awards/gardels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kenneth D. Gardels Award by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)&lt;/a> for 2014. The award is in recognition of his &amp;ldquo;significant contribution to the OGC&amp;rsquo;s essential role and mission in the global Information Technology community&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jeffrey K. Harris, Chairman of the OGC Board of Directors, said: &amp;ldquo;We wish to express our deep appreciation for the extraordinary contribution you have made to the OGC community and to people around the world who are the ultimate beneficiaries of improvements in the development, management and use of geoscientific data. Devoting your time and bringing your dedication, expertise, critical thinking and leadership to OGC working groups has resulted in significant and enduring advances in technical standards. The value you&amp;rsquo;ve createdhas been leveraged, and the OGC&amp;rsquo;s work overall has been leveraged, through your active participation in other standards bodies, expert groups, councils and commissions. We thank you for this collaborative work, for it benefits us all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Peter is editor of twelve adopted standards related to the OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) suite of Big Geo Data standards. Recently he has been instrumental in establishing a new Big Data Domain Working Group within the OGC which he also co-chairs. Peter&amp;rsquo;s research focuses on large-scale scientific information services, in particular: massive multi-dimensional data cubes. He has architected the
&lt;a href="http://www.rasdaman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rasdaman&lt;/a> (&amp;ldquo;raster data manager&amp;rdquo;) technology which has pioneered a new research field, Array Databases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/ianJackson.jpg" alt="Ian Jackson">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Geological Society of America honoured &lt;strong>Ian Jackson&lt;/strong> with their
&lt;a href="http://www.geosociety.org/awards/14speeches/geoinfo.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outstanding Contributions in Geoinformatics award&lt;/a> for 2014. The award recognises an individual who has contributed in an outstanding manner to geology through the application of the principles of geoinformatics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ian was a councillor of CGI from 2004 to 2012. Ian understood the importance of standards to achieve the opening of geoscientific data for diverse uses, and took a decisive part in the recreation of the IUGS-CGI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The award citation notes Ian&amp;rsquo;s long and superb service to advance the field of geoinformatics through his pioneering work at the British Geological Survey, to the establishment and unprecedented success of the OneGeology initiative. A dominant theme throughout Ian&amp;rsquo;s career has been the wide application of geoscience data for societal benefit, a goal he continues to promote as a consultant on the international stage. Ian has been one of the first in geological survey organizations worldwide to understand, and more importantly, to change the organization of the survey to fulfill its role of &amp;ldquo;information agency.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Among his many accomplishments, Ian is perhaps best known as the primary instigator of OneGeology - a global initiative to make digital geological map data accessible throughout the world. Ian&amp;rsquo;s colleagues uniformly refer to his ability to inspire others on the OneGeology concept and build a strong team with the skills to create OneGeology, his keen awareness of how to get things done, and his ability to find constructive ways around obstacles as key to the success of the initiative.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-working-group-chair">New Working Group Chair&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/markRattenbury.jpg" alt="Mark Rattenbury">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mark Rattenbury from GNS-New Zealand is the new chair of the CGI Geoscience Terminology Working Group. Mark took over from Steve Richard who handed over the reins after many years of inspirational leadership of CGI&amp;rsquo;s vocabulary development team. Mark has extensive experience in geological mapping, particularly of complexly deformed and metamorphosed basement terranes of Australia, Antarctica, and New Zealand. He led the 1:250 000 scale Geological Map of New Zealand programme to its conclusion in 2010 and is a specialist in geological map data management and dissemination using GIS software and web services. Mark is also a participant in the OGC/CGI GeoSciML Standards Working Group, as well as being the New Zealand representative on the OneGeology Technical Implementation Group.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/mine.jpg" alt="Mine">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CGI Geoscience Terminology Working Group (GTWG) recently published 18 new geoscience vocabularies at the
&lt;a href="http://resource.geosciml.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CGI&amp;rsquo;s vocabulary resources website&lt;/a>. The vocabularies describe features of mineral resources such as resource shape and form, exploration and mining activities, and resource and reserve classifications. The GTWG worked in collaboration with the EarthResourceML Working Group to compile the new vocabularies to support the EarthResourceML data transfer standard, most importantly as the standard for mineral resource data transfer for the EU INSPIRE initiative.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/project/earthresourceml/">EarthResourceML Working Group&lt;/a> recently approved the adoption of 18 new vocabularies to support delivery of mineral occurrence and mine data using the EarthResourceML data transfer standard. The vocabularies have been developed in collaboration with the European Union’s Minerals Intelligence Network for Europe (Minerals4EU), so that Minerals4EU vocabularies use either exactly the same terms or have mappings to CGI terminology. The vocabularies are to be published soon through the
&lt;a href="http://resource.geosciml.org" title="http://resource.geosciml.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CGI&amp;rsquo;s vocabulary service&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/3d.jpg" title="3D geological data model">&lt;img src="https://cgi-iugs.github.io/img/3d.jpg" alt="3D geological data model">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By nature, geological information is 3D (or even 4D). To date, CGI efforts to support geological data interoperability have focused on exchange of geological map and borehole information with GeoSciML and EarthResourceML, using GML as the underlying spatial data engine. With the growing demand for exchanging 3D geological models in many domains (eg, oil and gas, mining, groundwater, design of infrastructure), there is a clear need for standardizing the exchange of 3D models independently of the data format used by the modeling software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is currently no accepted generic exchange model for 3D geological models, although there have been some attempts in different organizations or projects. The CGI Council considers it a priority for the Commission to&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>review the current situation in the delivery of 3D geological models, and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>propose a strategy for identifying or developing an agreed standard possibly in partnership with other standardization bodies.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We are now calling for volunteers to participate in an ad-hoc group to be setup in CGI on this topic. If you are interested, please email the CGI Chair,
